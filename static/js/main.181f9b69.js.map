Косметические средства для лечения и профилактики кожных проблем. Линия Sensibio - уход за чувствительной кожей, лечение себорейного дерматита, купероза Bioderma Sensibio Micelle solution (Биодерма Сенсибио H2O мицелловый раствор) - подходит всем типам кожи, в том числе чувствительной и реактивной. Внешний вид и свойства: Консистенция жидкая, подобная обычной воде, цвет прозрачный без примесей, запах почти отсутствует. Если банку потрясти, она начинает немного пенится. Мицеллярная вода содержит мицеллы - сферические жидкие кристаллы, образуемые поверхностно-активными веществами, молекулы которых сгруппированы в сферы, где они ориентированы своими липофильными концами в середину, а гидрофильными - наружу. Размер таких шариков крайне мал, их диаметр около 0,00001 мм. Мицеллярная структура: - нейтрализует раздражающее действие, присущее всем поверхностно-активным веществам; - обеспечивает  эффективное удаление с поверхности кожи не только водорастворимых, но и жировых загрязнений, которые активно захватываются мицеллами. Поэтому мицеллярный раствор является оптимальным средством для снятия макияжа. Чувствительность кожи может проявляться не только в виде легкого покраснения, но и различных проявлений розацеа. Лаборатория Bioderma разработала культовую мицеллярную воду Sensibio H2O с отличной переносимостью и наилучшими результатами. Сегодня это первое и единственное средство с высокой эффективностью среди продуктов данной категории, направленных на очищение кожи. Каждые 5 секунд в мире продается один флакон Сенсибио Н2О. Sensibio H2O предназначена для мягкого ухода за чувствительной кожей: она удаляет все виды загрязнений и декоративную косметику с кожи лица и глаз. Мицелловый раствор бережно и тщательно очищает, успокаивает, регенерирует и освежает кожные покровы, уменьшает проявления покраснения. Применяется также для снятия водостойкого макияжа. После применения средства нет необходимости умываться, что экономит время. В состав мицеллярной воды от Биодермa включены уникальные вещества: • мицеллы эфиров жирных кислот, по структуре аналогичные фосфолипидам эпидермиса; • экстракт огурца успокаивает реактивную кожу Специальные особенности: Без спирта, парабенов и отдушек.

Эйкозаноиды регулируют тонус гладкой мускулатуры, влияя на артериальное давление, состояние бронхов, кишечника, матки. Регулируют секрецию воды и натрия почками. Влияют на свёртываемость крови. Регулируют состояние слизистой оболочки желудка. Участвуют в формировании процесса воспаления при повреждении тканей и инфекции (боль, отёк, лихорадка). Некоторые эйкозаноиды являются нейромедиаторами и выполняют функцию гормонов. В организме эйкозаноиды синтезируются из жирных кислот семейства Омега-3 (важнейшие из которых альфа-линоленовая, докозагексаеновая, эйкозапентаеновая) и семейства Омега-6 (главные из которых линолевая и гамма-линоленовая). Количество и баланс этих кислот может серьёзно влиять на состояние здоровья человека. Чрезмерное потребление линолевой кислоты может привести к избыточной концентрации в организме воспалительных эйкозаноидов, которые способны сужать кровеносные сосуды, уменьшать просвет бронхов и повышать кровяное давление. Известный американский врач-кардиолог Роберт Аткинс в своей книге «Биодобавки доктора Аткинса: Природная альтернатива лекарствам при лечении и профилактике болезней» (Dr. Atkins Vita-Nutrient Solution: Nature's Answers to Drugs (1997) Simon and Schuster) упоминал, что смещение баланса в сторону воспалительных эйкозаноидов коррелирует с подавлением иммунной функции, раком и такими воспалительными заболеваниями, как астма и артрит. Для баланса необходима гамма-линоленовая кислота (ГЛК) - важный фактор стабилизации обменных процессов. Специальный фермент Дельта-6-Десатураза (Д6Д) преобразует жиры Омега-6 в ГЛК. У многих людей нет достаточного количества Д6Д. Способность к выработке данного фермента теряется с возрастом, активность его подавляется при потреблении большого количества сахара, алкоголя, гидрогенизированных масел. Кроме того, потерю этого фермента могут вызывать или усиливать диабет, гипотиреоз, вирусные инфекции. Для выработки Д6Д необходима помощь витаминов C, В3 и В6, а также, цинка и магния. Недостаток любого из этих веществ приводит к снижению выработки этого фермента в организме. Большое количество людей попадает в ту или иную категорию недостаточности Д6Д. Таким людям необходимо потреблять больше готовой гамма-линоленовой кислоты, которая редко, но встречается в природе в составе некоторых растительных масел, таких как масло энотеры (примулы вечерней), масло бурачника (огуречника), кедровое масло. В кедровом масле содержится, в среднем, около 20% гамма-линоленовой кислоты и около 60% линолевой кислоты. По содержанию витамина Е (токоферола) кедровое масло в 5 раз превосходит оливковое масло и в 3 раза кокосовое. Токоферолы являются антиоксидантами прямого действия, защищают ПНЖК и липиды клеточных мембран от перекисного окисления и повреждения свободными радикалами, регулируют обмен белков, жиров, углеводов, способствуют усвоению жиров, витаминов А и D. Также в состав кедрового масла входят витамины В1, В2, В3. «Омега 3-6-9» содержит в равных долях: - кедровое масло; - высокоочищенный рыбий жир, стабилизированный смесью натуральных токоферолов; - льняное масло. Кедровое масло выступает источником жирных кислот Омега-6, в том числе, самой ценной из них - ГЛК. Льняное масло и рыбий жир выступают источниками Омега-3 жирных кислот, основными из которых являются альфа-линоленовая, эйкозапентаеновая и докозагексаеновая. Омега-3 жирные кислоты концентрируются, в основном, в тканях мозга, зрительном аппарате, включаются в липидный бислой клеточных мембран, регулируя их микровязкость и проницаемость. Включение жирных кислот Омега-3 в рацион питания оказывает благоприятное комплексное воздействие на организм при: • повышенном риске развития сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний; • повышенной физической и нервно-психической нагрузке, стрессах; • профилактике простудных заболеваний; • сезонных депрессиях; • высоком холестерине; • восстановлении после перенесённых заболеваний; • ломкости волос и сухости кожи; • несбалансированном, неполноценном питании и в период соблюдения диет. Омега-9 - семейство ненасыщенных жирных кислот, которые не являются незаменимыми (эссенциальными) жирными кислотами в отличие от Омега-3 и Омега-6. Омега-9 кислоты могут быть синтезированы человеческим организмом. Кроме того, жирные кислоты Омега-9 являются распространёнными компонентами как животных жиров, так и растительных масел и, как правило, присутствуют в питании человека в достаточном количестве.

Особенно важны для здоровья сердечно-сосудистой системы правильное питание, ограничивающее поступление в организм насыщенных жиров и холестерина, и  адекватное потребление необходимых полиненасыщенных жирных кислот (ПНЖК) Омега-3. Многочисленными клиническими исследованиями показано, что полиненасыщенные жирные кислоты Омега-3 положительно влияют на снижение липопротеинов  низкой плотности, нормализуют соотношение холестерина и триглицеридов в крови, что очень важно в борьбе с заболеваниями сердечно-сосудистой системы, в том числе атеросклерозом. Полиненасыщенные жирные кислоты Омега-3 тормозят процессы тромбообразования, обеспечивают поддержание иммунного статуса организма, нормализуют мозговое кровообращение, повышая устойчивость сосудов головного мозга при гипоксии и падении артериального давления, способствуют улучшению памяти, обладают противовоспалительным действием. Витамин Е предотвращает отложение холестерина в стенках сосудов, обеспечивает защиту клеток, предохраняет сердце от повреждений, связанных с дефицитом магния или с недостатком кислорода. Витамин Е также положительно влияет на состояние суставов. Таким образом,  комплекс   полиненасыщенных жирных кислот Омега-3 и витамина Е очень важен для нормализации липидного обмена и снижения риска развития сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний, в том числе атеросклероза.

Тиамина дифосфат является коферментом пируватдекарбоксилазы, 2-оксиглютаратдегидрогеназы и транскетолазы, участвуя, таким образом, в пентозофосфат-ном цикле окисления глюкозы (в переносе альдегидной группы). Пиридоксин Фосфорилированная форма пиридоксина (витамина В6) - пиридоксальфосфат - является коферментом ряда ферментов, влияющих на все этапы неокислительного метаболизма аминокислот. Пиридоксальфосфат участвует в процессе декарбоксилирования аминокис-лот, и, следовательно, в образовании физиологически активных аминов (например, адре-налина, серотонина, дофамина, тирамина). Участвуя в трансаминировании аминокислот, пиридоксальфосфат вовлечен в анаболические и катаболические процессы (например, являясь коферментом таких трансаминаз, как глутамат-оксалоцетат-трансаминаза, глута-мат-пируват-трансаминаза, гамма-аминобутировая кислота (GABА), а-кетоглутарат-трансаминаза), а также в различные реакции распада и синтеза аминокислот.

Бенфотиамин всасывается за счет активной резорбции при концентрациях ≤ 2 мкмоль и за счет пассивной диффузии при концентрациях ≥ 2 мкмоль. Являясь жирорастворимым производным тиамина (вита-мина В1), бенфотиамин всасывается быстрее и более полно, чем водорастворимый тиами-на гидрохлорид. Образующийся в кишечнике S-бензоилтиамин всасывается в основном не превращаясь в тиамин. Распределение S-бензоилтиамин жирорастворим, обладает высокой проникающей способностью. Осо-бенно высокое содержание коферментов тиамина дифосфата и тиамина трифосфата наблюдается в крови, печени, почках, мышцах и головном мозге. Метаболизм В кишечнике бенфотиамин превращается в S-бензоилтиамин в результате дефосфорили-рования фосфатазами. За счет ферментативного дебензоилирования после всасывания об-разуется тиамин и биологически активные коферменты тиамина дифосфат и тиамина трифосфат. Выведение Бенфотиамин выводится преимущественно почками. Примерно 50% тиамина выводится в неизмененном виде или в виде сульфата. Оставшуюся часть составляют несколько ме-таболитов, среди которых выделяют тиаминовую кислоту, метилтиазо-уксусную кислоту и пирамин.

Распределение и метаболизм В плазме крови пиридоксальфосфат и пиридоксаль связаны с альбумином. Перед про-никновением через клеточную мембрану пиридоксальфосфат, связанный с альбумином, гидролизуется щелочной фосфатазой с образованием пиридоксаля.

Миссия - помогать людям вести здоровый и осознанный образ жизни, предлагая экологически-чистые альтернативы для ежедневного рациона питания. ЕДИМ С ПОЛЬЗОЙ КОЛЛАГЕН КОМПЛЕКСНЫЙ  - Биологически активная добавка (БАД) к пище Производство коллагена в человеческом организме начинает снижаться примерно к 40 годам. Это приводит к появлению морщин, отвисанию и дряблости кожи, а также к изменениям в суставах, нарушающим полноценную двигательную активность. За счет достаточного количества коллагена поддерживается упругость кожи и ее молодость. Гидролизованный говяжий коллаген легко усваивается организмом. Синтез коллагена в организме не возможен без витамина C, поэтому препарат уже содержит аскорбиновую кислоту в нужных концентрациях в рекомендуемой дозе. Капсула состоит из коллагена в виде порошка, аскорбиновой кислоты, желатиновой оболочки. На коллаген приходится почти треть всех белков в человеческом организме. Входит в состав суставов, сухожилий, волос, ногтей, кожи, костей, зубов. Свойства: -улучшение качества кожи. Повышается упругость кожи, ее влажность и плотность; -снижение риска развития остеоартрита, облегчает восстановление после травм и снижает болевые ощущения в суставах; -улучшение силовых показателей. Увеличение мышечной массы, восстановление мышечных волокон; -укрепление стенок сосудов; -укрепление и увеличение роста волос и ногтей; -улучшение работы кишечника; -ускорение метаболизма помогает при борьбе с лишним весом.

Обнинск). Они соединили селен с биомолекулой  ксантеном - антиоксидантом, который является составной частью природных антиоксидантов - витамина Е и биофлавонидов. Полученное соединение не вызывает никаких побочных эффектов, даже при концетрациях, в сотни раз превышающих предельно допустимые. Описание активных компонентов: Суточная потребность человека в селене составляет 80-200 мкг. Это очень небольшая доза. При условии ежедневного поступления такого количества, за всю жизнь суммарный объём не превысит и половины чайной ложки! И даже это небольшое количество, к сожалению, получить с современными продуктами питания невозможно. Наши почвы практически не содержат селена. В результате каждый второй житель России страдает дефицитом селена. Восполнить недостаток селена помогает препарат \\\"СЕЛЕН-АКТИВ\\\". Это абсолютно безопасное средство разработчики назвали - умным элементом. Все дело в том, что молекула препарата, в которую встроен селен, в зависимости от потребности организма может работать либо как источник селена для органов и тканей, либо как самостоятельный антиоксидант. «Селен-Актив» прошел клинические исследования в ГНИЦ профилактической медицины Минздрава РФ и НИИ питания РАМН. Результаты показали, что прием таблеток «Селен-Актив» у больных с ишемической болезнью сердца, артериальной гипертонией и нарушением липидного обмена в дополнение к терапии сердечно-сосудистыми препаратами приводит к уменьшению интенсивности окислительных процессов, снижению уровня холестерина и артериального давления. «Селен-Актив» рекомендован в качестве дополнительного источника селена и витамина С: для улучшения функционального состояния сердечно-сосудистой системы; в качестве средства для нормализации обмена холестерина; для повышения функциональной активности антиоксидантной системы организма.

Значение этих полиненасыщенных жирных кислот связано со структурно-функциональной организацией клеточных мембран. Они являются предшественниками образующихся из них активных и важных биорегуляторов – эйкозаноидов линии Е3, влияют на процессы тромбообразования и тонус кровеносных сосудов. Включаясь в липидный бислой клеточных мембран полиненасыщенные жирные кислоты омега-3 регулируют их микровязкость, проницаемость, формируют соответствующее липидное окружение мембранных белков и ферментов, способствуют метаболизму холестерина в печени и его элиминированию из организма. В наше время дефицит потребления омега-3 среди детского и взрослого населения России составляет порядка 80%. Недостаток поступления омега-3 в организм сопровождается нарушением эластичности и текучести всех клеточных мембран организма и изменением жидкостных соотношений в водном балансе и ионных потоках, что неблагоприятно отражается на внутриклеточной передаче информации. 1 - Используется только натуральный рыбий жир запатентованной марки MEG-3®, производства швейцарской компании «DSM» - ведущего лидера в сфере производства биодобавок.

Она заключается в том, что создаются биоподобные мицеллы, которые во много раз повышает всасывание полезных веществ организмом. Без них мы можем усвоить всего 10-15% витаминов и микроэлементов из пищи или биодобавки, а с помощью мицелл - 100%. «Мицеллярные витамины ADEK» («Micellar vitamins ADEK») - Биологически активная добавка (БАД) к пище - это витаминный комплекс, который содержит в себе витамины А, Е, D, К. Они улучшают обмен веществ, делают кожу лучше, укрепляют кости, зубы, волосы и ногти, способствуют повышению выносливости нервной системы, укрепляют мышцы. Улучшают циркуляцию крови, обеспечивают ее нормальную свертываемость, нормализуют работу мужской и женской репродуктивных систем. Витамины помогают при астме и диабете, очищают кровеносные сосуды от сгустков, защищают от остеопороза, способствуют правильному синтезу белка. Препарат улучшает свертываемость крови, применяется при травмах и ранениях, помогает вылечить язвенные болезни Препарат предназначен для восполнения дефицита витаминов А, Д, Е, К и при состояниях, требующих их повышенного поступления (спорт, изменения климатических условий, повышенные физические и эмоциональные нагрузки, прием препаратов или наличие заболеваний, вызывающих дефицит жирорастворимых витаминов, пожилой возраст).

Действующие вещества заключены в «продуктовые мицеллы» диаметром около 30 нм, которые являются основным компонентом солюбилизатов NovaSOL. Солюбилизаты устойчивы к кислотам (pH независимы), температуре и механическому воздействию, являются амфифильными (водо- и жирорастворимыми), имеют органическую формулу, исключающую наличие неорганических нано частиц (полностью метаболизируются в организме). Обладают повышенной биодоступностью и скоростью кишечного всасывания, ультратонким распределением. Имитируют природную структуру физиологических мицелл. Выводятся печенью и почками без повышения нагрузки на эти органы. Активные ингредиенты: -Витамин А осуществляет в организме две главные функции: способствует нормальному росту и развитию организма (принимает участие в синтезе стероидных гормонов (прогестерон), сперматогенезе, в окислительно-восстановительных процессах (синтез АТФ), регуляции синтеза белков, в формировании костей и зубов, необходим для роста новых клеток, замедляет процесс старения, способствует поддержанию постоянного уровня сахара в крови, помогая организму более эффективно использовать инсулин) и обеспечивает нормальное функционирование зрения, особенно сумеречного (входит в состав зрительных пигментов родопсина и йодопсина). Витамин А обеспечивает нормальное функционирование слезных, сальных, потовых желез и повышает устойчивость организма к инфекциям. Потребность в витамине А резко возрастает при повышении температуры окружающей среды и времени пребывания на солнце, при низкожировом питании. -Витамин Д регулирует фосфорно-кальциевый обмен (стимулирует выработку в кишечнике белка-носителя, необходимого для транспорта кальция, в почках и мышцах усиливает реабсорбцию кальция) и участвует в синтезе серотонина (отвечает за хорошее настроение и сон). От него зависит развитие костей, зубов, волос, качество мышечного сокращения, восприимчивость организма к кожным заболеваниям, болезням сердца и к раку. В странах, где пища бедна витамином Д, повышена заболеваемость атеросклерозом, артритами, диабетом, особенно 1 типа. Потребность в витамине Д возрастает при длительном пребывании в помещении, в более холодное время года, при низкожировом питании. -Витамин Е: препятствует тромбообразованию, участвует в синтезе гормонов, процессах тканевого дыхания, поддерживает иммунитет, обладает антиканцерогенным эффектом, обеспечивает нормальное функционирование мускулатуры и половых желез. Потребность в витамине Е увеличивается в более холодное время года и при низкожировом питании. -Витамин К: принимает участие в синтезе в печени протромбина (обеспечивает свертывание крови), участвует в обмене веществ в костях, соединительной ткани и работе почек.

Железо относится к незаменимым микроэлементам необходимым для нормальной жизнедеятельности человека. При недостатке железа нарушается синтез гемоглобина, который выполняет важнейшую функцию в теле человека - транспорт кислорода к клеткам. Нормальное содержание железа важно для всех людей, но именно у женщин чаще всего наблюдается недостаток этого элемента вследствие регулярной ежемесячной потери крови, а также во время беременности, грудного вскармливания, в период роста и физического развития, полового созревания. Также в группу риска по дефициту железа входят и те, кто потребляет в больших количествах кофе, чай и другие напитки с кофеином. Кофеин ухудшает всасывание железа и может способствовать проявлению или усугублять имеющийся железодефицит. Солгар «Легкодоступное железо Джентл Айрон» содержит 25 мг железа в органической форме.

Действие: для повышения умственной работоспособности, уменьшения нервного и умственного напряжения, улучшения сна. Содержание в 2 таблетках (суточном приеме): Глицин, не менее 600 мг, что составляет 17% от адекватного уровня суточного потребления Пиридоксин (витамин B6), не более 6 мг, что составляет 300%* от адекватного уровня суточного потребления Тиамин (витамин B1), не более 5 мг, что составляет  357%* от адекватного уровня суточного потребления Витамин B12, не более 9 мкг, что составляет 900%* от адекватного уровня суточного потребления *Не превышает верхний допустимый уровень суточного потребления. Глицин Форте Эвалар отличается: 1. Высоким содержанием глицина (300 мг). В норме у человека преобладает влияние парасимпатической нервной системы (спокойствие), а при длительной нервной нагрузке баланс нарушается, и более активной становится симпатическая нервная система (активность). В результате повышенная активность, которая необходима человеку для решения конкретных задач, становится преобладающим состоянием перевозбуждения, которым сложно управлять. При этом снижается концентрация внимания, появляется чувство беспокойства, все труднее найти выход из сложной ситуации. Умственное напряжение, невозможность уснуть, расслабиться приводят к истощению нервной системы. С проблемой такого уровня сложно справиться самому. Во всем мире для решения этих проблем широко используется глицин - как нелекарственное средство, способствующее уменьшению стресса и умственного перенапряжения, причем в значительных количествах. 2. Действие глицина усилено витаминами B1, B6, B12 в таком соотношении, как они существуют в природе. Витамины группы В благотворно влияют на центральную и периферическую нервную систему, способствуют восстановлению поврежденных нервных волокон, помогают противодействовать стрессу. 3. Таблетки легко рассасываются, что способствует быстрому достижению эффекта: -повышению умственной работоспособности; -уменьшению нервного и умственного напряжения; -улучшению сна. Глицин Форте Эвалар не формирует зависимости при длительном приеме, поскольку содержит естественные для организма действующие компоненты. Специальные особенности: без сахара, без глютена, без ГМО.

На протяжении десятилетий БИОСИЛ® дает людям по всему миру огромные преимущества в сохранении здоровья и красоты. Красота, юность и здоровье Взаимосвязь между красотой, молодостью и здоровьем (и это медицинский факт) очевидна. Основополагающим критерием этих аспектов является количество и качество коллагена в организме человека. Его название происходит от греческого слова kolla (клей), что в целом описывает основную функцию вещества - он составляет основу соединительной ткани организма. То есть, коллаген отвечает за нормальное функционирование кожи, волос, ногтей, костей, хрящей, кровеносной системы. Организм человека синтезирует коллаген самостоятельно, но с возрастом и под воздействием различных факторов данная способность нарушается, а запас белка начинает истощаться. В молодом возрасте его уровень достаточен, а структура имеет плотный сетчатый рисунок. Поэтому молодая кожа выглядит гладкой, увлажненной и упругой, ногти остаются крепкими и ровными, а волосы - густыми, сильными и блестящими, излучая здоровье и красоту и функционируя с максимальной эффективностью. Невозможно переоценить роль коллагена и в строении костей, ведь именно он увеличивает их минеральную плотность, придавая так необходимые им гибкость и прочность. Более того, коллаген является основным компонентом суставов, сухожилий, связок и хрящей. Также важна его роль в поддержании здоровья кровеносных сосудов, сердца, легких, почек и печени. Метаболизм коллагеновых волокон на фоне возрастных изменений После 21 года уровень коллагена и эластина начинает уменьшаться на 1-1,5% в год. Именно тогда коллагеновая «сетка» начинает разрушаться. Начиная с этого возраста женская кожа становится тоньше на 7% каждые 10 лет. Кроме этого, в течение первых 5-ти лет после наступления менопаузы содержание коллагена в организме снижается на 6% в год. Потеря коллагена снижает и минеральную плотность костей, приводя к их ломкости. УФ-лучи также являются существенным фактором, приводящим к снижению уровня коллагена в коже. Курение, стресс и плохое питание - все это также ведет к потере коллагена и эластина, в результате чего кожа становится тоньше. Потеря коллагена и эластина влияет и на правильное функционирование внутренних органов и зрения. Снижение уровня эстрогена и высокий уровень гомоцистеина также являются причиной расщепления коллагена в организме человека. Возможен ли синтез коллагена Как часто хочется вернуть что-то безнадежно потерянное! Это особенно актуально в отношении коллагена. И не удивительно - результаты двойных слепых плацебо-контролируемых клинических испытаний показывают существенное улучшение выработки коллагена у пациентов, принимающих БИОСИЛ®. Он действительно запускает процесс синтеза собственного коллагена, работая естественным образом. В организм не попадает ничего постороннего, он просто активизирует природные ферменты, генерирующие коллаген. Именно поэтому происходит выработка своего собственного, естественного коллагена, подобно тому, как это происходит в 18 лет. И это коллаген с отпечатком собственной ДНК! Кроме того, клинически доказано, что БИОСИЛ® абсолютно безопасен. Он позволяет вернуть утраченный, генерировать новый и защищать существующий коллаген от расщепления. Как защитить существующий и вновь сформированный коллаген от будущей потери БИОСИЛ® активирует ферменты, вырабатывающие коллаген, благодаря чему происходит восстановление утраченного и синтез нового. Но одной из особенностей, которые делают БИОСИЛ® поистине уникальным препаратом, является его способность защищать существующий и недавно полученный коллаген. Каким же образом? Вы наверняка слышали о гомоцистеине. Он является одной из важнейших аминокислот, которые входят в состав клеток нашего организма. Этот компонент участвует в общем метаболизме, обеспечивает нормальный кровоток, работу сердечно-сосудистой системы и безвреден при нормальных значениях. При его повышенном уровне происходит разрушение коллагена. Вот почему ученые часто называют его «антиколлагеновой» аминокислотой. Повышение уровня гомоцистеина в организме может быть результатом процесса старения или следствием менопаузы. Но есть и хорошие новости - активный ингредиент БИОСИЛ®, запатентованный комплекс ch-OSA® (стабилизированная холином ортокремниевая кислота) нейтрализует разрушительное действие гомоцистеина при его повышенном уровне. Это означает, что прием БИОСИЛ® дает возможность вырабатывать новый коллаген, защищая и существующий. Как доказана эффективность БИОСИЛ® Понятие «клинически проверенный» в научном мире не всегда базируется на серьезной доказательной базе. И тестирование препарата не означает, что результаты будут непременно положительными. Такие термины, как «клинические исследования» или «клиническая оценка» употребляются даже при проведении весьма неформальных тестов, в том числе, на малочисленных группах участников. Результаты часто выражаются «мнением», а не научными показателями. Золотой стандарт тестирования - двойное слепое рандомизированное плацебо-контролируемое клиническое исследование. Результаты таких испытаний должны быть рассмотрены как «статистически значимые» и опубликованы в рецензируемых медицинских журналах, прежде чем какие-либо факты могут быть предъявлены общественности. Именно этим стандартам следуют разработчики БИОСИЛ®. Как скоро станет видимым результат приема БИОСИЛ® БИОСИЛ® начинает работать с первого же дня приема, активируя вырабатывающие коллаген ферменты. И неважно, какова потеря коллагена на этот момент. Далее приведены результаты клинических испытаний БИОСИЛ® как в отношении поддержания здоровья и красоты. Результаты клинических исследований* Измерения в отношении кожи проводились через 20 недель, для волос - через 36 недель приема. БИОСИЛ® способствует • уменьшению тонких линий и морщин до 30% • повышению эластичности кожи до 89% • увеличению толщины волос до 12,8% • усилению крепости волос до 13,1% • видимому укреплению ногтевой пластины В отношении воздействия на костную ткань БИОСИЛ® помогает • повышать минеральную плотность костей при тестировании в критической области бедра до 2% • увеличить образование коллагена в костной ткани и суставах до 15% Данные клинические испытания включали измерение минеральной плотности костей и прирост в выработке коллагена в течение 365 дней приема (стандартный интервал для измерения значимого улучшения здоровья костной ткани). Приведенные результаты показывают улучшения, выходящие за рамки преимуществ от ежедневного приема 1000 мг кальция и 800 МЕ витамина D. *Приведены данные по отношению к показателям после приема плацебо. Результаты могут варьироваться. Какого эффекта ожидать Каждый человек индивидуален. Как быстро станут видимыми результаты приема БИОСИЛ®, зависит от целого ряда аспектов - возраст, генетика, рацион питания, образ жизни и так далее. Однако, есть средние временные рамки, которые принимают во внимание. Кожа Клинические испытания показали, что БИОСИЛ® уменьшает тонкие линии и морщины до 30% и делает кожу более эластичной до 89%. Это результаты измерений, сделанных после 20-ти недель приема. Но это не означает, что в течение этого времени не происходило никаких других улучшений. БИОСИЛ® начинает работать с первого же дня приема. Еще один аспект, характеризующий здоровое состояние кожи - степень ее увлажненности. Молодая кожа хорошо увлажнена, отличается упругостью и эластичностью. Такую гидратацию изнутри обеспечивает гликозаминогликаны - семейство молекул, которые вместе с волокнами коллагена и эластина образуют в тканях соединительный матрикс. По сути, они работают, как магниты, притягивающие влагу. Коллаген служит связующим звеном для этих увлажняющих молекул. Больше коллагена означает их большее количество. Вот почему возрастная потеря коллагена сопровождается уменьшением гликозаминогликанов и вызывает сухость кожи. БИОСИЛ® помогает восстановить утраченный, синтезировать новый и защитить существующий коллаген. Прием препарата прекрасно увлажняет кожу изнутри, делая ее более красивой, молодой и здоровой. Волосы Различия в темпах роста, состоянии и качестве волос у разных людей также объясняются возрастом, генетикой и влиянием окружающей среды. Однако, клинически доказано, что после 36-ти недель приема БИОСИЛ® толщина волос увеличивается до 12,8%, а крепость - до 13,1%. Прием препарата заставляет также волосы расти намного быстрее. Кроме густоты и силы, есть еще одно потрясающее преимущество, которое дает БИОСИЛ® - он придает волосам прекрасный блеск. Это неудивительно, поскольку он помогает накапливать в структуре волоса больше кератина, разглаживая его поверхность и делая ее более гладкой и светоотражающей. Ногти Как и волосы, ногти на 98% состоят из кератина. С годами его синтез в организме ослабевает. Вот почему ногти с возрастом чаще ломаются или трескаются. Слабость ногтей может быть и следствием нехватки витаминов. Но здоровые и крепкие ногти будут ровными и гладкими. Исследования показывают, что клинически подтвержденный комплекс ch-OSA® в БИОСИЛ® помогает улучшить структуру кератина в ногтях. Результат - более крепкие, ровные, красивые ногти. Улучшение состояния ногтей - первое преимущество, которое становится заметным после начала приема БИОСИЛ®. Это и есть видимое доказательство того, что препарат по-настоящему работает. Кости Клинические испытания БИОСИЛ® доказали, что его прием в сочетании с кальцием и витамином D всего за 1 год увеличивает минеральную плотность костной ткани на полные и клинически значимые 2%, а образование коллагена - до 15%. Для действительно крепких и здоровых костей требуется именно сочетание кальция и коллагена. Матрица коллагена служит связующим участком для всего костного кальция. Больше коллагена означает больше костных минералов. Еще более важно то, что он придает костям гибкость, необходимую для того, чтобы выдерживать нагрузки, например, сопротивление при внезапном ударе. Поддерживая их крепкими и упругими, можно сохранить энергию и активность на всю жизнь. БИОСИЛ®, помогает увеличить образование костного коллагена и усилить минеральную плотность костной ткани. Суставы Суставы представляют собой комбинацию из хрящей, связок, сухожилий и, конечно, костей. Но есть то, что связывает эти компоненты - все они почти полностью состоят из коллагена. Когда содержание коллагена уменьшается с возрастом или в результате травмы, суставы ослабевают. Коллаген снижает дегенеративность хрящевой ткани в случае остеоартрита, оказывая стимулирующий эффект на метаболизм протеогликанов в хрящевых клетках. Выработка коллагена оказывает поддержку здоровому функционированию суставов. Ученые, занимающиеся их изучением, называют коллаген их важнейшим структурным компонентом. Клинически доказано, что БИОСИЛ® способствует образованию коллагена в суставах. Именно поэтому большинство людей, принимающих БИОСИЛ® для лечения суставов, сообщают об улучшении уже в течение первых недель приема (наступление эффекта, однако, зависит от индивидуальных особенностей человека). В любом случае, БИОСИЛ® поможет вернуться к активному образу жизни, сделать вас более здоровыми и счастливыми! Почему недостаточно просто принимать коллаген, чтобы увеличить его уровень в организме В отличие от кальция, который можно принимать для увеличения его содержания в костной ткани, с коллагеном все не так просто. При приеме коллагена в виде таблеток, порошков, напитков или пептидов, организм воспринимает его не более, чем источник белка, расщепляя на аминокислоты и используя, прежде всего, в качестве источника пищи. Такова изначальная природа нашего орагнизма - поддерживать жизнь, а не красоту. Главная цель - синтез коллагена, а не увеличение его уровня за счет коллагеносодержащих препаратов. Но именно кремний способен сделать выработку коллагена наиболее эффективной. Поэтому и был создан БИОСИЛ® с комплексом стабилизированной холином ортокремниевой кислоты ch-OSA®, способный запустить процесс синтеза собственного коллагена. Что не менее важно, БИОСИЛ® не содержит каких-либо компонентов животного происхождения или морских организмов. Коллаген, который вы получаете с его помощью, вырабатывается естественным путем. Активируя производящие коллаген ферменты, БИОСИЛ® запускает процесс его синтеза в вашем организме. И вновь полученный коллаген будет иметь отпечаток вашей собственной ДНК! Как принимать БИОСИЛ® БИОСИЛ® можно принимать в любое удобное время, вне зависимости от приема пищи. БИОСИЛ® в жидкой форме можно просто добавить вместе с другими ингредиентами в блендер при смешивании любимого коктейля - бьюти-шейк БИОСИЛ® быстрого приготовления готов! Температура не влияет на эффективность БИОСИЛ®, поэтому его можно смешивать с горячим или холодным напитком. Можно ли принимать БИОСИЛ® вместе с другими пищевыми добавками Комбинированный прием с другими добавками никак не влияет на эффективность БИОСИЛ®. В любом случае, результат гарантирован. Можно ли принимать БИОСИЛ® вместе с лекарствами, отпускаемыми по рецепту Известных противопоказаний, которые запрещали бы принимать БИОСИЛ® с любыми лекарствами, отпускаемыми по рецепту, не существует. Однако, в качестве меры предосторожности, рекомендуем принимать БИОСИЛ® по крайней мере за час до или после приема любого лекарства, отпускаемого по рецепту или без него.

Антоцианы черники стимулируют синтез и естественное обновление зрительного пигмента родопсина, способствуя повышению остроты зрения, улучшению адаптации к темноте и условиям пониженной освещенности. При этом ускоряется процесс естественного обновления сетчатки и снижается усталость глаз от продолжительной работы. Комплекс биофлавоноидов черники и рутина с витамином C способствует укреплению сосудистой стенки, улучшению кровоснабжения глаз и поддержанию нормального внутриглазного давления. Комплекс витаминов группы B необходим для протекания нормальных метаболических процессов в тканях глаза. Витамин B1 повышает зрительную работоспособность, тогда как его недостаток вызывает мышечную слабость, в том числе тканей глаза. При дефиците витамина B2 наблюдается покраснение глаз, появляется чувство жжения в глазах и веках. При дефиците витамина B6 может наблюдаться повышенное напряжение и подергивание глаз. Цинк необходим для образования основного зрительного пигмента родопсина и проведения световых сигналов через сетчатку, благодаря чему он защищает глаза от структурных изменений, вызванных ярким светом, УФ-излучением или другими видами окислительного стресса.

Изучая физиологию человека, Лайнус пришёл к выводу, что большинство хронических болезней обусловлено нехваткой витаминов и микроэлементов. Присутствие в организме «правильной массы» этих вещест помогает сохранить здоровье и улучшить состояние во время болезни. Фармацевтические компании творчески развили идеи Полинга. Продуктовая линейка Ортомол включает 28 комплексов для мужчин и женщин, любого возраста и образа жизни. Каждый витаминный комплекс предназначен для решения конкретных задач. Этим обусловлена эффективность витаминов Ортомол: улучшение самочувствия наступает почти сразу, излечение болезни происходит после двух-трёх курсов принятия витаминов.

Стимулирует клеточный метаболизм и процесс образования новых клеток. Витамин А модулирует процессы дифференцирования эпителиальных клеток, принимает участие в развитии секреторных желез, процессах кератинизации, регенерации слизистых оболочек и кожи. Благоприятно влияет на работу глаз: необходим в синтезе зрительных пигментов, участвующих в сумеречном и цветовом зрении. Участие витамина А в синтезе мукополисахаридов - компонентов соединительной ткани, хрящей и костей, способствует формированию и укреплению костной и мышечной ткани. Витамин А необходим в синтезе половых гормонов, участвует в механизме образования и созревания сперматозоидов и яйцеклеток. Кроме того, витамин А поддерживает в нормальном функциональном состоянии работу иммунной системы, за счет стимуляции процесса образования интерферона, иммуноглобулина А, лизоцима. Играет важную роль в окислительно-восстановительных процессах. Токоферола ацетат (витамин Е) обладает выраженным антиоксидантным действием, тормозит развитие свободно-радикальных реакций, предупреждает образование перекисей, повреждающих клеточные и субклеточные мембраны. Восстанавливает капиллярное кровообращение, нормализует тканевую проницаемость, повышает устойчивость тканей к гипоксии. Под влиянием витамина Е происходит синтез белков: коллагена в подкожной клетчатке и костях, сократительных белков в скелетных, гладких мышцах и миокарде, белков слизистых оболочек и плаценты, а также ферментов печени, креатинфосфокиназы, вазопрессиназы и гонадотропных гормонов. Витамин Е является эффективным иммуномодулятором, способствующим укреплению иммунозащитных сил организма. Витамины А и Е являются жирорастворимыми витаминами, обладают синергизмом - эффектом усиления биологической активности, более сильным, чем сумма действия при их раздельном применении. Наличие в составе продукта льняного масла способствует лучшему усвоению витаминов А и Е за счет содержащихся в масле полиненасыщенных жирных кислот (омега-3, омега-6).

Содержание полиненасыщенных жирных кислот (ПНЖК) омега-3 в льняном масле почти вдвое выше, чем в рыбьем жире. Можно сказать, что льняное масло является «живым продуктом», поэтому его нужно оберегать от нагрева и  воздействия прямых солнечных лучей.  Желатиновая оболочка позволяет сохранить полезные свойства льняного масла, поэтому капсульная форма выпуска предпочтительнее  жидкой формы. Льняное масло предупреждает болезни сосудов и образование тромбов. Ежедневное употребление льняного масла способствует профилактике развития сердечных приступов, так как из-за уменьшения вязкости крови и нормализации уровня жиров в крови нагрузка на сердце снижается. Употребление в пищу ПНЖК способствует снижению показателей артериального давления. Льняное масло облегчает течение предменструального синдрома и пременопаузы, улучшает состояние кожи и волос, способствует заживлению повреждённых тканей.

Описание компонентов: Полиненасыщенные кислоты Омега-3 (ПНЖК Омега-3) - необходимый элемент в образовании клеточных мембран тканей всего организма. Омега-3 - это группа полиненасыщенных жирных кислот, важнейшими из которых являются докозагексаеновая кислота (ДГК), эйкозапентаеновая кислота (ЭПК) и альфа-линоленовая кислота (АЛК), относящиеся к незаменимым (эссенциальным) веществам. Незаменимые вещества необходимы для нормальной жизнедеятельности человека, но не синтезируются организмом или синтезируются в недостаточном количестве. Основным источником ДГК и ЭПК является рыбий жир, тогда как АЛК содержится преимущественно в растительных маслах. Потребность организма человека в ДГК и ЭПК намного выше, чем в АЛК, поэтому ДГК и ЭПК считаются основными веществами группы Омега-3 необходимыми человеку. ПНЖК Омега-3 полезны при: • Повышенном риске развития сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний • Высоком холестерине • Профилактике простудных заболеваний • Хронических воспалительных процессах • Повышенной физической и нервно-психической нагрузке, стрессах • Беременности и кормлении грудью • Сезонных депрессиях • Ломкости волос и сухости кожи • В период восстановления после перенесенных заболеваний • При несбалансированном и неполноценном питании и в период соблюдения диет Пищевая и энергетическая ценность 1 капсулы массой 1500 мг: белки 0,3 г, жиры 1 г; 46 кДж/10 ккал;\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Показания\",\n        \"description\": \"в качестве биологически активной добавки к пище - дополнительного источника полиненасыщенных жирных кислот Омега-3, в том числе эйкозапентаеновой и докозагексаеновой кислот.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Противопоказания\",\n        \"description\": \"индивидуальная непереносимость компонентов.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Способ применения и дозы\",\n        \"description\": \"взрослым по 1 капсуле массой 1500 мг 1 раз в день во время еды.

Омега-3 - группа полиненасыщенных жирных кислот, жизненно необходимых нашему организму. Всего в эту группу входит 11 разновидностей жирных кислот. Незаменимыми (не вырабатываются организмом в нужном объеме) являются лишь три: - альфа-линоленовая (АЛК), - эйкозапентаеновая кислота (ЭПК), - докозагексаеновая (ДГК). АЛК  является кислотой только растительного происхождения. А кислоты ЭПК и ДГК содержатся в рыбьем жире. Омега-3 для спорта Для получения хороших результатов в спорте необходима корректировка рациона питания. Помимо большого количества белка, витаминов и микроэлементов, в рацион важно добавить омега-3 жирные кислоты. Регулярное употребление омега-3 значительно улучшает метаболизм белка, помогает ему легче усвоиться, а значит, укреплять мышцы. Кроме того, одной из причин разрушения мышц является воспаление, с которым борется омега-3. Так как омега-3 жирные кислоты участвуют в формировании клеточных мембран, то за счет этого они позволяют сохранять эластичность сухожилий, связок, хрящей, способствуют улучшению свойств внутрисуставной смазки, замедляют распад коллагеновых волокон. Омега-3 снижают уровень «плохого» холестерина, защищают сосуды и капилляры, поддерживают общий тонус организма, что помогает повысить выносливость на тренировках. Кроме того, омега-3 жирные кислоты обеспечивают более быстрое восстановление после физических нагрузок и травм. Поэтому, если вы занимаетесь спортом принимайте омега-3 от компании «Эвалар» для лучших результатов и поддержания здоровья Специальные особенности: не содержит сахара, ГМО, глютена\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Показания\",\n        \"description\": \"в качестве биологически активной добавки к пище – дополнительного источника полиненасыщенных жирных кислот (ПНЖК) омега-3 (эйкозапентаеновой и докозагексаеновой кислоты), в том числе для беременных и кормящих женщин.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Противопоказания\",\n        \"description\": \"Индивидуальная непереносимость компонентов.

Как работают ингредиенты Омега-6 (гамма-линоленовая кислота (ГЛК) - из кедрового масла, линолевая кислота (ЛК) - из льняного и кедрового масла) Особенно важным ингредиентом комплекса Омега 3-6-9 Супер от Эвалар является гамма-линоленовая кислота (ГЛК/GLA) - кислота из класса омега-6. Наличие ГЛК - это отличительная особенность кедрового масла. Несмотря на то, что ГЛК может синте зироваться в организме из линолевой кислоты, ее поступление с пищей чрезвычайно важно, так как со временем в организме снижается фермент, переводящий линолевую кислоту в ГЛК, и с возрастом этот процесс усиливается. ГЛК принимает участие в выработке гормоноподобных веществ - простагландин, которые помогают подавлять воспалительные, атопические1 и аутоиммунные процессы в организме. Существует несколько различных типов простагландинов, правильный баланс которых абсолютно необходим для того, чтобы организм был здоров. Простагландины, которые синтезируются из ГЛК, обладают выраженным противовоспалительным эффектом и являются важной частью клеточных мембран. Это и объясняет такое мощное действие ГЛК в борьбе с преждевременным старением, болезнями сердца, артритом, аллергиями. Кроме того, гипотензивное2, гипохолестеринемическое3, гиполипидемическое4, желчегонное и ранозаживляющее действие кедрового масла также связывают с активностью ГЛК в его составе. Омега-3 (эйкозапентаеновая кислота - из рыбьего жира, докозагексаеновая кислота - из рыбьего жира, альфа-линоленовая кислота - из льняного масла) Эйкозапентаеновая (ЭПК/EPA) и докозагексаеновая (ДГК/DHA) кислоты являются незаменимыми омега-3 жирными кислотами - то есть сами они не вырабатываются в организме. Низкий уровень этих кислот может вызвать серьезные проблемы со здоровьем. Они совершенно необходимы для многих функций организма, включая развитие и нормальное функционирование глаз и мозга. Исследования в области сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний показывают, что жители северных районов (эскимосы), которые в 10 раз меньше, по сравнению, например, с американцами, страдают сердечными заболеваниями. Также эскимосы реже заболевают раком, артритом, ожирением и диабетом. Это связывают с высоким потреблением жирной рыбы, богатой омега-3. У японцев, которые потребляют больше морских продуктов, чем американцы, также снижен уровень риска сердечных заболеваний. Современные исследования показывают, что омега-3 могут оказывать действие на артрит и псориаз, так как они обладают антивоспалительными свойствами. Прием их в больших дозах может снизить риск развития хронических воспалительных заболеваний. Кислоты класса омега-3 важны для работы всего организма, однако можно выделить ряд органов и систем, которым эти кислоты необходимы в первую очередь: • сердечно-сосудистая система • нервная система • иммунная система • органы зрения • кожа Омега-3 могут помочь снизить вязкость крови, улучшить кровоток, уменьшить уровень «плохого» холестерина, снижая тем самым вероятность образования тромбов, а также развития атеросклероза, ишемической болезни сердца, инфаркта и инсульта. Альфа-линоленовая кислота (АЛК/ALA) также является незаменимой омега-3 жирной кислотой. Ее основными источниками являются растительные масла, например, льняное. АЛК - главный компонент секрета сальных желез, обуславливающих защитное действие кожи. Омега-9 (олеиновая кислота - из льняного и кедрового масла) Наиболее важной из класса омега-9 кислот является олеиновая кислота (ОК/DA). Она присутствует в мембранах клеток и способствует поддержанию эластичности артерий и кожи. Также установлено, что в странах Средиземноморья, где в пищу употребляют большое количество оливкового масла, оливок, маслин, авокадо, орехов, относительно редко встречаются случаи сердечно-сосудистых и онкологических заболеваний. В большой степени это относится на счет омега-9 жирных кислот, присутствующих во всех этих пищевых продуктах. Признаки дефицита омега-9 в организме следующие: может развиваться общее или хроническое недомогание, от слабой усталости до сердечного приступа. Характерными признаками нехватки омега-9 в организме также является обострение сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний, повышение артериального давления, боли в суставах, артриты, ухудшение пищеварения, запоры, снижение иммунитета, частые простуды, ангина, депрессия, рассеянность, ухудшение памяти, усталость, недомогание, сухость кожи и слизистых, ломкие ногти, сухие, безжизненные волосы.

Являясь жирорастворимым производным тиамина (витамина В1), бенфотиамин всасывается быстрее и более полно, чем водорастворимый тиамина гидрохлорид. В кишечнике бенфотиамин превращается в S-бензоилтиамин в результате дефосфорилирования фосфатазами. S-бензоилтиамин жирорастворим, обладает высокой проникающей способностью и всасывается в основном не превращаясь в тиамин. За счет ферментативного дебензоилирования после всасывания образуется тиамин и биологически активные коферменты тиамина дифосфат и тиамина трифосфат.

Фармакокинетический профиль цетиризина аналогичен у взрослых и детей. У детей после приема цетиризина в дозе 5 мг концентрация активной субстанции в организме, такая же, как и у взрослых после приема 10 мг. У взрослых после приема цетиризина в дозе 10 мг максимальная концентрация (Cmax) в плазме крови достигается через 1-2 часа и составляет 350 нг/мл. У детей после приема цетиризина в дозе 5 мг Cmax в плазме крови достигается через 1 час и составляет 275 нг/мл. При приеме цетиризина в форме капель максимальные концентрации в плазме крови достигаются с более высокой скоростью. Распределение Распределение после приема 10 мг составляет 35 литров у взрослых, а связывание с белками плазмы крови - 93 %. У детей объем распределения после приема 5 мг составляет примерно 17 литров. Незначительное количество цетиризина выделяется в грудное молоко.

Прием нескольких доз не изменяет фармакокинетические параметры. При приеме препарата в суточной дозе 10 мг в течение 10 дней кумуляции цетиризина не наблюдалось. После окончания лечения уровень цетиризина в плазме крови быстро падает ниже определяемых пределов. Повторные аллергологические тесты можно возобновить через 3 дня. Отдельные группы пациентов Пожилые пациенты: У 16 пожилых лиц при однократном приеме препарата в дозе 10 мг T1/2 был выше на 50 %, а скорость выведения была ниже на 40 % по сравнению с контрольной группой. Снижение клиренса цетиризина у пожилых пациентов вероятно связано с уменьшением функции почек у этой категории пациентов.

В некоторых случаях была зарегистрирована парадоксальная стимуляция ЦНС. Несмотря на то, что цетиризин является селективным блокатором периферических H1-рецепторов и практически не оказывает антихолинергического действия, сообщалось о единичных случаях затруднения мочеиспускания, нарушениях аккомодации и сухости во рту.

У пациентов с повреждением спинного мозга, гиперплазией предстательной железы, а также при наличии других предрасполагающих факторов к задержке мочи, требуется соблюдение осторожности, так как цетиризин может увеличивать риск задержки мочи. У пациентов с почечной недостаточностью режим дозирования препарата следует корректировать (смотри раздел «Способ применения и дозы»). Из-за возможного снижения функции почек у пациентов пожилого возраста режим дозирования препарата следует корректировать (смотри раздел «Способ применения и дозы»). Рекомендовано соблюдать осторожность при применении цетиризина одновременно с алкоголем, так как цетиризин может привести к повышенной сонливости. Осторожность следует соблюдать у пациентов с эпилепсией и повышенной судорожной готовностью. Перед назначением аллергологических проб рекомендован трехдневный «отмывочный» период ввиду того, что H1-гистаминовых рецепторов блокаторы ингибируют развитие кожных аллергических реакций.

При беременности назначение цетиризина возможно после консультации с врачом, в случае если предполагаемая польза для матери превышает потенциальный риск для плода. Период грудного вскармливания Не следует применять цетиризин во время грудного вскармливания, т.к. цетиризин выделяется с грудным молоком в количестве от 25 % до 90 % от концентрации в плазме крови, в зависимости от времени отбора проб после приема препарата. Нежелательные реакции, связанные с цетиризином, могут наблюдаться у грудных детей. В период грудного вскармливания применяют после консультации с врачом, если предполагаемая польза для матери превышает потенциальный риск для ребенка. Фертильность Доступные данные о влиянии на фертильность человека ограничены, однако отрицательного влияния на фертильность в исследованиях на животных не выявлено.

В некоторых случаях была зарегистрирована парадоксальная стимуляция ЦНС. Несмотря на то, что цетиризин является селективным блокатором периферических              Н1-рецепторов и практически не оказывает антихолинергического действия, сообщалось о единичных случаях затруднения мочеиспускания, нарушениях аккомодации и сухости во рту. Сообщалось о нарушениях функции печени, сопровождающихся повышением уровня печеночных ферментов и уровня билирубина. В большинстве случаев нежелательные явления разрешались после прекращения приема цетиризина. Перечень нежелательных побочных реакций Имеются данные, полученные в ходе двойных слепых контролируемых клинических исследований, направленных на сравнение цетиризина и плацебо или других антигистаминных препаратов, применяемых в рекомендованных дозах (10 мг один раз в сутки для цетиризина) более чем у 3200 пациентов, на основании которых можно провести достоверный анализ данных по безопасности.

Фармакокинетический профиль цетиризина аналогичен у взрослых и детей. У детей после приема цетиризина в дозе 5 мг концентрация активной субстанции в организме такая же, как и у взрослых после приема 10 мг. У взрослых после приема цетиризина в дозе 10 мг максимальная концентрация (Cmax) в плазме крови достигается через 1-2 часа и составляет 350 нг/мл. У детей после приема цетиризина в дозе 5 мг Cmax в плазме крови достигается через 1 час и составляет 275 нг/мл. При приеме цетиризина в форме капель максимальные концентрации в плазме крови достигаются с более высокой скоростью. Распределение Распределение после приема 10 мг составляет 35 литров у взрослых, а связывание с белками плазмы крови - 93 %. У детей объем распределения после приема 5 мг составляет примерно 17 литров. Незначительное количество цетиризина выделяется в грудное молоко.

Выведение После приема 10 мг у взрослых общий клиренс цетиризина составляет 0,60 мл/мин/кг; период полувыведения (T1/2) составляет примерно 10 часов. Прием нескольких доз не изменяет фармакокинетические параметры. При приеме препарата в суточной дозе 10 мг в течение 10 дней кумуляции цетиризина не наблюдалось. После окончания лечения уровень цетиризина в плазме крови быстро падает ниже определяемых пределов. Повторные аллергологические тесты можно возобновить через 3 дня. Отдельные группы пациентов Пожилые пациенты: У 16 пожилых лиц при однократном приеме препарата в дозе 10 мг T1/2 был выше на 50 %, а скорость выведения была ниже на 40 % по сравнению с контрольной группой. Снижение клиренса цетиризина у пожилых пациентов вероятно связано с уменьшением функции почек у этой категории пациентов.

В некоторых случаях была зарегистрирована парадоксальная стимуляция ЦНС. Несмотря на то, что цетиризин является селективным блокатором периферических H1-рецепторов и практически не оказывает антихолинергического действия, сообщалось о единичных случаях затруднения мочеиспускания, нарушениях аккомодации и сухости во рту. Сообщалось о нарушениях функции печени, сопровождающихся повышением уровня активности печеночных ферментов и уровня билирубина. В большинстве случаев нежелательные явления разрешались после прекращения приема цетиризина. Перечень нежелательных побочных эффектов Имеются данные, полученные в ходе двойных слепых контролируемых клинических исследований, направленных на сравнение цетиризина и плацебо или других антигистаминных препаратов, применяемых в рекомендованных дозах (10 мг один раз в сутки для цетиризина) более чем у 3200 пациентов, на основании которых можно провести достоверный анализ данных по безопасности. Согласно результатам объединенного анализа, в плацебо-контролируемых исследованиях при применении цетиризина в дозе 10 мг были выявлены следующие нежелательные реакции с частотой 1,0 % или выше: Нежелательные реакции (терминология ВОЗ) Цетиризин 10 мг (n = 3260) Плацебо (n = 3061) Общие нарушения и нарушения в месте введения Утомляемость 1,63 % 0,95 % Нарушения со стороны нервной системы Головокружение Головная боль 1,10 % 7,42 % 0,98 % 8,07 % Нарушения со стороны желудочно-кишечного тракта Боль в животе Сухость во рту Тошнота 0,98 % 2,09 % 1,07 % 1,08 % 0,82 % 1,14 % Нарушения психики Сонливость 9,63 % 5,00 % Нарушения со стороны дыхательной системы, органов грудной клетки и средостения Фарингит 1,29 % 1,34 % Хотя частота случаев сонливости в группе цетиризина была выше, чем таковая в группе плацебо, в большинстве случаев это нежелательное явление было легкой или умеренной степени тяжести. При объективной оценке, проводимой в рамках других исследований, было подтверждено, что применение цетиризина в рекомендованной суточной дозе у здоровых молодых добровольцев не влияет на их повседневную активность. Дети В плацебо-контролируемых исследованиях у детей в возрасте от 6 месяцев до 12 лет были выявлены следующие нежелательные реакции с частотой 1 % и выше: Нежелательные реакции (терминология ВОЗ) Цетиризин (n = 1656) Плацебо (n = 1294) Нарушения со стороны желудочно-кишечного тракта Диарея 1,0 % 0,6 % Нарушения психики Сонливость 1,8 % 1,4 % Нарушения со стороны дыхательной системы, органов грудной клетки и средостения Ринит 1,4 % 1,1 % Общие нарушения и нарушения в месте введения Утомляемость 1,0 % 0,3 % Опыт пострегистрационного применения Помимо нежелательных явлений, выявленных в ходе клинических исследований и описанных выше, в рамках пострегистрационного применения препарата наблюдались следующие нежелательные реакции.

Одновременный прием азитромицина, эритромицина, кетоконазола, теофиллина и псевдоэфедрина не выявил существенных изменений в клинических лабораторных показателях, жизненно важных функциях и ЭКГ. В исследовании с одновременным приемом теофиллина (400 мг в день) и цетиризина (20 мг в день) было обнаружено незначительное, но статистически достоверное повышение 24-часовой AUC (площади под кривой) на 19 % для цетиризина и на 11 % для теофиллина. Кроме того, максимальные уровни в плазме крови увеличились до 7,7 % и 6,4 % соответственно для цетиризина и теофиллина. Одновременно клиренс цетиризина уменьшился на -16 %, а также на -10 % в случае теофиллина, когда цетиризин принимали пациенты, которые ранее получали лечение теофиллином. Тем не менее, предварительное лечение цетиризином не оказало существенного влияния на фармакокинетические параметры теофиллина.

У пациентов с повреждением спинного мозга, гиперплазией предстательной железы, а также при наличии других предрасполагающих факторов к задержке мочи, требуется соблюдение осторожности, так как цетиризин может увеличивать риск задержки мочи. У пациентов с почечной недостаточностью режим дозирования препарата следует корректировать (смотри раздел «Способ применения и дозы»). Из-за возможного снижения функции почек у пациентов пожилого возраста режим дозирования препарата следует корректировать (смотри раздел «Способ применения и дозы»). Рекомендовано соблюдать осторожность при применении цетиризина одновременно с алкоголем, так как цетиризин может привести к повышенной сонливости. Осторожность следует соблюдать у пациентов с эпилепсией и повышенной судорожной готовностью. Перед назначением аллергологических проб рекомендован трехдневный «отмывочный» период ввиду того, что блокаторы H1-гистаминовых рецепторов ингибируют развитие кожных аллергических реакций.

Прием пищи увеличивает время достижения максимальной концентрации (Тmах) лоратадина и дезлоратадина приблизительно на 1 час, но не оказывает влияния на эффективность лекарственного препарата. Максимальная концентрация (Сmах) лоратадина и дезлоратадина не зависит от приема пищи. У пациентов с хроническими заболеваниями почек максимальная концентрация (Сmах) и площадь под кривой «концентрация-время» (AUC) лоратадина и его активного метаболита увеличиваются по сравнению с пациентами с нормальной функцией почек. Периоды полувыведения лоратадина и его активного метаболита при этом не отличаются от таковых у здоровых пациентов. У пациентов с алкогольным поражением печени Сmах и AUC лоратадина увеличиваются в два раза по сравнению с данными показателями у пациентов с нормальной функцией печени, в то время как фармакокинетика его активного метаболита существенно не меняется. Лоратадин имеет высокую степень (97-99%), а его активный метаболит - умеренную степень (73-76%) связывания с белками плазмы. Лоратадин метаболизируется в дезлоратадин посредством системы цитохрома Р450 3А4 и, в меньшей степени, системы цитохрома Р450 2D6. Выводится через почки (приблизительно 40% принятой внутрь дозы) и через кишечник (приблизительно 42% принятой внутрь дозы) в течение более чем 10 дней, преимущественно в виде конъюгированных метаболитов. Приблизительно 27% принятой внутрь дозы выводится через почки в течение 24 часов после приема лекарственного препарата. Менее 1% активного вещества выводится через почки в неизменном виде в течение 24 часов после приема лекарственного препарата.

Монтелукаст селективно ингибирует CysLT рецепторы цистеиниловых лейкотриенов эпителия дыхательных путей. Цистеинил лейкотриеновые рецепторы 1 типа (CysLT рецепторы) присутствуют в дыхательных путях человека, в том числе в клетках гладких мышц бронхов, макрофагах и других провоспалительных клетках (включая эозинофилы и некоторые миеловидные стволовые клетки). Цистеинил лейкотриены (LTС4, LTD4, LTE4) относятся к классу эйкозаноидов, образующихся из арахидоновой кислоты, и являются медиаторами воспаления, образующимися в различных клетках организма, в том числе в тучных клетках и эозинофилах. Цистеинил лейкотриены коррелируют с патофизиологией бронхиальной астмы и аллергического ринита. При аллергическом рините после воздействия аллергена происходит высвобождение цистеинил лейкотриенов из противовоспалительных клеток слизистой оболочки полости носа во время ранней и поздней фаз аллергической реакции, что проявляется симптомами аллергического ринита. При интраназальной пробе с цистеинил лейкотриенами было продемонстрировано повышение симптомов назальной обструкции. Монтелукаст с высоким сродством и избирательностью связывается с CysLTl рецепторами, снижает число эозинофилов в периферической крови, в дыхательных путях. Левоцетиризин - R энантиомер цетиризина; конкурентный антагонист гистамина; блокирует Hl гистаминовые рецепторы, сродство к которым в 2 раза выше, чем у цетиризина. Левоцетиризин оказывает влияние на гистаминозависимую стадию аллергических реакций; уменьшает миграцию эозинофилов, уменьшает сосудистую проницаемость, ограничивает высвобождение медиаторов воспаления и цитокинов (VCAM 1 и других). Левоцетиризин предупреждает развитие и облегчает течение аллергических реакций, оказывает антиэкссудативное, противозудное действие; практически не оказывает антихолинергического и антисеротонинового действия. В терапевтических дозах практически не оказывает седативного действия. Действие начинается через 12 минут после приема однократной дозы у 50% пациентов, через 1 час - у 95% и продолжается в течение 24 часов.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Фармакокинетика\",\n        \"description\": \"Абсорбция Монтелукаст быстро и практически полностью всасывается после приема внутрь. Прием обычной пищи не влияет на биодоступность и максимальную концентрацию в плазме (Сmax) монтелукаста. У взрослых при приеме натощак монтелукаста в виде таблеток, покрытых пленочной оболочкой, в дозировке 10 мг, Сmax достигается через 3 часа. Биодоступность при приеме внутрь составляет 64%. Левоцетиризин быстро и полностью всасывается из желудочно-кишечного тракта при приеме внутрь; прием пищи не оказывает влияния на полноту всасывания, но снижает его скорость. Биодоступность достигает 100%. Время достижения максимальной концентрации в плазме крови (ТСmax) - 0,9 часа, максимальная концентрация в плазме крови (Сmax)   270 нг/мл, равновесная концентрация достигается через 2 суток. Распределение Монтелукаст связывается с белками плазмы крови более чем на 99%. Объем распределения монтелукаста составляет в среднем 8 11 литров. Левоцетиризин на 90% связывается с белками плазмы крови. Объем распределения составляет 0,4 л/кг. Метаболизм Монтелукаст активно метаболизируется в печени. При использовании терапевтических доз концентрации метаболитов монтелукаста в плазме в равновесном состоянии у взрослых и у детей не определяются. Предполагается, что в процесс метаболизма монтелукаста вовлечены изоферменты цитохрома Р450 CYP (ЗА4 и 2С9), при этом в терапевтических концентрациях монтелукаст не ингибирует изоферменты цитохрома Р450 CYP: ЗА4, 2С9, 1А2, 2А6, 2С19 и 2D6. У людей метаболизируется менее 14% дозы левоцетиризина, так как предполагаемые различия в фармакокинетическом профиле левоцетиризина вследствие генетического полиморфизма или одновременного приема ингибиторов ферментов незначительны. Метаболические превращения заключаются в окислении ароматического кольца, N  и О деалкилировании и конъюгации с таурином. Процесс деалкилирования, главным образом, осуществляется с помощью изофермента CYP3A4, в то время как окисление ароматического кольца происходит с помощью многих и/или неустановленных CYP изоформ. Левоцетиризин при приеме внутрь в дозе 5 мг и/или при превышении максимальных концентраций в плазме крови не оказывает влияния на активность CYP изоферментов 1А2, 2С9, 2С19, 2D6, 2Е1, 3А4. Благодаря ограниченному метаболизму и отсутствию метаболической ингибирующей активности взаимодействие левоцетиризина на уровне метаболизма с другими веществами маловероятно. Выведение Клиренс монтелукаста составляет у здоровых взрослых в среднем 45 мл/мин. После перорального приема монтелукаста 86% от принятой дозы выводится кишечником в течение 5 дней и менее 0,2% - почками, что подтверждает то, что монтелукаст и его метаболиты экскретируются почти исключительно с желчью. Период полувыведения у здоровых взрослых составляет от 2,7 до 5,5 часа. Фармакокинетика монтелукаста сохраняет практически линейный характер при приеме внутрь доз свыше 50 мг. При приеме монтелукаста в утренние и вечерние часы различий в фармакокинетике не наблюдается. При приеме 1 раз в сутки монтелукаста в лекарственной форме таблетки, покрытые пленочной оболочкой, 10 мг наблюдается умеренная (около 14%) кумуляция активного вещества в плазме. Период полувыведения левоцетиризина (Т1/2) у взрослых составляет 7,9 ± 1,9 ч. Средний наблюдаемый общий клиренс - 0,63 мл/мин/кг. Полностью выводится из организма в течение 95 часов. Около 85,4% принятой дозы препарата выводится почками, около 12,9%   через кишечник. При почечной недостаточности (клиренс креатинина (КК) менее 40 мл/мин) клиренс снижается (у пациентов, находящихся на гемодиализе   на 80%, что требует изменения соответствующего режима дозирования), период полувыведения (Т1/2)   удлиняется. Менее 10% удаляется в ходе стандартной 4 часовой процедуры гемодиализа. Особенности фармакокинетики монтелукаста у различных групп пациентов Пол Фармакокинетика монтелукаста у женщин и мужчин одинакова. Пожилые пациенты При приеме внутрь 1 раз в сутки таблеток, покрытых пленочной оболочкой, содержащих 10 мг монтелукаста, фармакокинетический профиль и биодоступность сходны у пожилых людей и пациентов молодого возраста. Данные по фармакокинетике левоцетиризина ограничены. При повторном приеме 30 мг левоцетиризина один раз в сутки в течение 6 дней у пожилых пациентов общий клиренс был приблизительно на 33% ниже, чем таковой у взрослых пациентов более молодого возраста. Было показано, что распределение рацемата цетиризина больше зависит от функции почек, чем от возраста, поэтому у пациентов пожилого возраста доза препарата должна быть скорректирована в зависимости от функции почек. Печеночная недостаточность У пациентов с печеночной недостаточностью легкой и средней степени тяжести и клиническими проявлениями цирроза печени отмечено замедление метаболизма монтелукаста, сопровождающееся увеличением площади под фармакокинетической кривой «концентрация-время» (AUC) приблизительно на 41% после однократного приема 10 мг монтелукаста. Период выведения монтелукаста у пациентов с печеночной недостаточностью незначительно увеличивается по сравнению со здоровыми добровольцами (среднее время полувыведения   7,4 часа). Коррекция дозы монтелукаста у пациентов с печеночной   недостаточностью   легкой и средней степени тяжести не требуется. Данных о характере фармакокинетики монтелукаста у пациентов с тяжелой печеночной недостаточностью (более 9 баллов по шкале Чайлд Пью) нет. Почечная недостаточность Поскольку монтелукаст и его метаболиты не экскретируются с мочой, фармакокинетика монтелукаста у пациентов с почечной недостаточностью не оценивалась. У пациентов с почечной недостаточностью при клиренсе креатинина менее 40 мл/мин клиренс левоцетиризина уменьшается. У пациентов, находящихся на гемодиализе, общий клиренс снижается на 80%, что требует изменения режима дозирования. Менее 10% удаляется в ходе стандартной 4 часовой процедуры гемодиализа. Дети У детей в возрасте от 6 до 11 лет с массой тела от 20 до 40 кг при приеме внутрь однократно 5 мг левоцетиризина показатели Сmах и площадь под кривой  «концентрация время» (AUC) примерно в два раза превышают аналогичные показатели у взрослых здоровых людей. Прием левоцетиризина в дозе 1,25 мг у детей в возрасте от 6 месяцев до 5 лет приводит к концентрации в плазме крови, соответствующей таковой у взрослых при приеме 5 мг препарата один раз в сутки.

Рекомендуемая терапевтическая доза монтелукаста не оказывает клинически значимого влияния на фармакокинетику следующих препаратов: теофиллина, преднизона, преднизолона, пероральных контрацептивов (этинилэстрадиол/норэтистерон 35/1), терфенадина, дигоксина и варфарина. Значение AUC снижается при одновременном приеме фенобарбитала (примерно на 40%), однако коррекция режима дозирования монтелукаста не требуется. Поскольку монтелукаст метаболизируется изоферментом CYP ЗА4 следует соблюдать осторожность, если монтелукаст одновременно назначается с препаратами, индуцирующими изофермент CYP ЗА4, такими как фенитоин, фенобарбитал и рифампицин. Однако изменения дозы монтелукаста не требуется. Исследования in vitro показали, что монтелукаст является потенциальным ингибитором изофермента CYP 2С8, однако данные клинических исследований взаимодействия препарат - препарат, включающих монтелукаст и росиглитазон (предварительный субстрат представителя медицинских препаратов, первично метаболизирующихся изоферментом CYP 2С8) показали, что дозы монтелукаста не ингибируют изоферменты CYP 2С8 in vivo. Следовательно, монтелукаст не оказывает заметного влияния на метаболизм препаратов, метаболизирующихся этим ферментом (например, паклитаксел, росиглитазон и репаглинид). Гемфиброзил (ингибитор CYP 2С8 и 2С9) повышает эффект системного воздействия монтелукаста в 4,4 раза. Однако влияние гемфиброзила на системное воздействие монтелукаста не может считаться клинически значимым на основании данных по безопасности при применении монтелукаста в дозах, превышающих одобренную дозу 10 мг. Поэтому при совместном приеме вместе с гемфиброзилом коррекция дозы монтелукаста не требуется. Совместный прием итраконазола, мощного ингибитора CYP ЗА4, вместе с гемфиброзилом и монтелукастом не приводил к дополнительному повышению эффекта системного воздействия монтелукаста. Левоцетиризин При изучении лекарственного взаимодействия рацемата цетиризина с феназоном, псевдоэфедрином, циметидином, кетоконазолом, эритромицином, азитромицином, глипизидом и диазепамом клинически значимых нежелательных взаимодействий не выявлено. Теофиллин (400 мг/сутки) снижает общий клиренс левоцетиризина на 16%, при этом кинетика теофиллина не изменяется. В исследовании при одновременном приеме ритонавира (600 мг 2 раза в сутки) и цетиризина (10 мг в сутки) показано, что экспозиция цетиризина увеличивалась на 40%, а экспозиция ритонавира незначительно изменялась (-11%). Совместное применение с макролидами или кетоконазолом не вызывало достоверных изменений на ЭКГ. В ряде случаев при одновременном применении левоцетиризина с алкоголем или лекарственными препаратами, оказывающими подавляющее влияние на центральную нервную систему (ЦНС), возможно усиление их влияния на ЦНС, хотя не доказано, что рацемат цетиризина потенцирует эффект алкоголя.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Особые указания\",\n        \"description\": \"Монтелукаст В редких случаях у пациентов, принимающих препараты для лечения бронхиальной астмы, включая монтелукаст, может возникнуть системная эозинофилия, иногда сопровождающаяся клиническими проявлениями васкулита и синдрома Чарджа Стросса.

Цистеинил лейкотриеновые рецепторы 1 типа (CysLT-рецепторы) присутствуют в дыхательных путях человека, в том числе в клетках гладких мышц бронхов, макрофагах и других провоспалительных  клетках (включая эозинофилы и некоторые миеловидные стволовые клетки). Цистеинил лейкотриены (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) относятся к классу эйкозаноидов, образующихся из арахидоновой кислоты, и являются медиаторами воспаления, образующимися в различных клетках организма, в том числе в тучных клетках и эозинофилах. Цистеинил лейкотриены коррелируют с патофизиологией бронхиальной астмы и аллергического ринита. При аллергическом рините после воздействия аллергена происходит высвобождение цистеинил лейкотриенов из противовоспалительных клеток слизистой оболочки полости носа во время ранней и поздней фаз аллергической реакции, что проявляется  симптомами аллергического ринита. При интраназальной пробе с цистеинил лейкотриенами было продемонстрировано повышение симптомов назальной обструкции. Монтелукаст с высоким сродством и избирательностью связывается с CysLT1-рецепторами, снижает число эозинофилов в периферической крови, в дыхательных путях. Левоцетиризин - R-энантиомер цетиризина; конкурентный антагонист гистамина; блокирует H1-гистаминовые рецепторы, сродство к которым в 2 раза выше, чем у цетиризина. Левоцетиризин оказывает влияние на гистаминозависимую стадию аллергических реакций; уменьшает миграцию эозинофилов, уменьшает сосудистую проницаемость, ограничивает высвобождение медиаторов воспаления и цитокинов (VCAM-1 и других). Левоцетиризин предупреждает развитие и облегчает течение аллергических реакций, оказывает антиэкссудативное, противозудное действие; практически не оказывает антихолинергического и антисеротонинового действия. В терапевтических дозах практически не оказывает седативного действия.

Левоцетиризин быстро и полностью всасывается из желудочно-кишечного тракта при приеме внутрь; прием пищи не оказывает влияния на полноту всасывания, но снижает его скорость. Биодоступность достигает 100 %. Время достижения максимальной концентрации в плазме крови (TCmax) - 0,9 часа, максимальная концентрация в плазме крови (Cmax) - 270 нг/мл, равновесная концентрация достигается через 2 суток. Распределение Монтелукаст связывается с белками плазмы крови более чем на 99 %. Объем распределения монтелукаста составляет в среднем 8-11 литров. Левоцетиризин на 90 % связывается с белками плазмы крови. Объем распределения составляет 0,4 л/кг. Метаболизм Монтелукаст активно метаболизируется в печени. При использовании терапевтических доз концентрации метаболитов монтелукаста в плазме в равновесном состоянии у взрослых и у детей не определяются. Предполагается, что в процесс метаболизма монтелукаста вовлечены изоферменты цитохрома P450 CYP (3A4 и 2C9), при этом в терапевтических концентрациях монтелукаст не ингибирует изоферменты цитохрома P450 CYP: 3A4, 2C9, 1A2, 2A6, 2C19 и 2D6. У людей метаболизируется менее 14 % дозы левоцетиризина, так как предполагаемые различия в фармакокинетическом профиле левоцетиризина вследствие генетического полиморфизма или одновременного приема ингибиторов ферментов незначительны. Метаболические превращения заключаются в окислении ароматического кольца, N- и O-деалкилировании и конъюгации с таурином. Процесс деалкилирования, главным образом, осуществляется с помощью изофермента CYP3A4, в то время как окисление ароматического кольца происходит с помощью многих и/или неустановленных CYP-изоформ. Левоцетиризин при приеме внутрь в дозе 5 мг и/или при превышении максимальных концентраций в плазме крови не оказывает влияния на активность CYP-изоферментов 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4. Благодаря ограниченному метаболизму и отсутствию метаболической ингибирующей активности взаимодействие левоцетиризина на уровне метаболизма с другими веществами маловероятно. Выведение Клиренс монтелукаста составляет у здоровых взрослых в среднем 45 мл/мин. После перорального приема монтелукаста 86 % от принятой дозы выводится кишечником в течение 5 дней и менее 0,2 % - почками, что подтверждает то, что монтелукаст и его метаболиты экскретируются почти исключительно с желчью. Период полувыведения у здоровых взрослых составляет от 2,7 до 5,5 часа. Фармакокинетика монтелукаста сохраняет практически линейный характер при приеме внутрь доз свыше 50 мг. При приеме монтелукаста в утренние и вечерние часы различий в фармакокинетике не наблюдается. При приеме 1 раз в сутки монтелукаста в лекарственной форме таблетки покрытые пленочной оболочкой 10 мг наблюдается умеренная (около 14 %) кумуляция активного вещества в плазме. Период полувыведения левоцетиризина (T1/2) у взрослых составляет 7,9 ± 1,9 ч. Средний наблюдаемый общий клиренс - 0,63 мл/мин/кг. Полностью выводится из организма в течение 95 часов. Около 85,4 % принятой дозы препарата выводится почками, около 12,9 % - через кишечник. При почечной недостаточности (клиренс креатинина (КК) менее 40 мл/мин) клиренс снижается (у пациентов, находящихся на гемодиализе - на 80 %, что требует изменения соответствующего режима дозирования), период полувыведения (T1/2) - удлиняется. Менее 10 % удаляется в ходе стандартной 4-часовой процедуры гемодиализа. Особенности фармакокинетики монтелукаста у различных групп пациентов Пол Фармакокинетика монтелукаста у женщин и мужчин одинакова. Пожилые пациенты При приеме внутрь 1 раз в сутки таблеток покрытых пленочной оболочкой, содержащих 10 мг монтелукаста, фармакокинетический профиль и биодоступность сходны у пожилых людей и пациентов молодого возраста. Данные по фармакокинетике левоцетиризина ограничены. При повторном приеме 30 мг левоцетиризина один раз в сутки в течение 6 дней у пожилых пациентов общий клиренс был приблизительно на 33 % ниже, чем таковой у взрослых пациентов более молодого возраста. Было показано, что распределение рацемата цетиризина больше зависит от функции почек, чем от возраста, поэтому у пациентов пожилого возраста доза препарата должна быть скорректирована в зависимости от функции почек. Печеночная недостаточность У пациентов с печеночной недостаточностью легкой и средней степени тяжести и клиническими проявлениями цирроза печени отмечено замедление метаболизма монтелукаста, сопровождающееся увеличением площади под фармакокинетической кривой «концентрация-время» (AUC) приблизительно на 41 % после однократного приема 10 мг монтелукаста. Период выведения монтелукаста у пациентов с печеночной недостаточностью незначительно увеличивается по сравнению со здоровыми добровольцами (среднее время полувыведения - 7,4 часа). Коррекция дозы монтелукаста у пациентов с печеночной недостаточностью легкой и средней степени тяжести не требуется. Данных о характере фармакокинетики монтелукаста у пациентов с тяжелой печеночной недостаточностью (более 9 баллов по шкале Чайлд-Пью) нет. Почечная недостаточность Поскольку монтелукаст и его метаболиты не экскретируются с мочой, фармакокинетика монтелукаста у пациентов с почечной недостаточностью не оценивалась. У пациентов с почечной недостаточностью при клиренсе креатинина менее 40 мл/мин клиренс левоцетиризина уменьшается. У пациентов, находящихся на гемодиализе, общий клиренс снижается на 80 %, что требует изменения режима дозирования. Менее 10 % удаляется в ходе стандартной 4-часовой процедуры гемодиализа. Дети У детей в возрасте от 6 до 11 лет с массой тела от 20 до 40 кг при приеме внутрь однократно 5 мг левоцетиризина показатели Сmax и площадь под кривой «концентрация-время» (AUC) примерно в два раза превышают аналогичные показатели у взрослых здоровых людей. Прием левоцетиризина в дозе 1,25 мг у детей в возрасте от 6 месяцев до 5 лет приводит к концентрации в плазме крови, соответствующей таковой у взрослых при приеме 5 мг препарата один раз в сутки.

Рекомендуемая терапевтическая доза монтелукаста не оказывает клинически значимого влияния на фармакокинетику следующих препаратов: теофиллина, преднизона, преднизолона, пероральных контрацептивов (этинилэстрадиол/норэтистерон 35/1), терфенадина, дигоксина и варфарина. Значение AUC снижается при одновременном приеме фенобарбитала (примерно на 40 %), однако коррекция режима дозирования монтелукаста не требуется. Поскольку монтелукаст метаболизируется изоферментом CYP 3A4 следует соблюдать осторожность, если монтелукаст одновременно назначается с препаратами, индуцирующими изофермент CYP 3A4, такими как фенитоин, фенобарбитал и рифампицин. Однако изменения дозы монтелукаста не требуется. Исследования in vitro показали, что монтелукаст является потенциальным ингибитором изофермента CYP 2C8, однако данные клинических исследований взаимодействия препарат - препарат, включающих монтелукаст и росиглитазон (предварительный субстрат представителя медицинских препаратов, первично метаболизирующихся изоферментом CYP 2C8) показали, что дозы монтелукаста не ингибируют изоферменты CYP 2C8 in vivo. Следовательно, монтелукаст не оказывает заметного влияния на метаболизм препаратов, метаболизирующихся этим ферментом (например, паклитаксел, росиглитазон и репаглинид). Гемфиброзил (ингибитор CYP 2C8 и 2C9) повышает эффект системного воздействия монтелукаста в 4,4 раза. Однако влияние гемфиброзила на системное воздействие монтелукаста не может считаться клинически значимым на основании данных по безопасности при применении монтелукаста в дозах, превышающих одобренную дозу 10 мг. Поэтому при совместном приеме вместе с гемфиброзилом коррекция дозы монтелукаста не требуется. Совместный прием итраконазола, мощного ингибитора CYP 3A4, вместе с гемфиброзилом и монтелукастом не приводил к дополнительному повышению эффекта системного воздействия монтелукаста. Левоцетиризин При изучении лекарственного взаимодействия рацемата цетиризина с феназоном, псевдоэфедрином, циметидином, кетоконазолом, эритромицином, азитромицином, глипизидом и диазепамом клинически значимых нежелательных взаимодействий не выявлено. Теофиллин (400 мг/сутки) снижает общий клиренс левоцетиризина на 16 %, при этом кинетика теофиллина не изменяется. В исследовании при одновременном приеме ритонавира (600 мг 2 раза в сутки) и цетиризина (10 мг в сутки) показано, что экспозиция цетиризина увеличивалась на 40 %, а экспозиция ритонавира незначительно изменялась (-11 %). Совместное применение с макролидами или кетоконазолом не вызывало достоверных изменений на ЭКГ. В ряде случаев при одновременном применении левоцетиризина с алкоголем или лекарственными препаратами, оказывающими подавляющее влияние на центральную нервную систему (ЦНС), возможно усиление их влияния на ЦНС, хотя не доказано, что рацемат цетиризина потенцирует эффект алкоголя.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Особые указания\",\n        \"description\": \"Монтелукаст В редких случаях у пациентов, принимающих препараты для лечения бронхиальной астмы, включая монтелукаст, может возникнуть системная эозинофилия, иногда сопровождающаяся клиническими проявлениями васкулита и синдрома Чарджа-Стросса. Такое состояние обычно лечат системными глюкокортикостероидами. Такие случаи обычно, но не всегда, связаны с уменьшением дозы или отменой пероральных глюкокортикостероидов.

Пациенты с подтвержденной аллергией к ацетилсалициловой кислоте и другим нестероидным противовоспалительным препаратам (НПВП) не должны принимать эти препараты в период лечения монтелукастом, поскольку он, улучшая дыхательную функцию у пациентов с аллергической бронхиальной астмой, тем не менее, не может полностью предотвратить бронхоконстрикцию, вызванную НПВП.

Тиамина дифосфат является коферментом пируватдекарбоксилазы, 2-оксиглютаратдегидрогеназы и транскетолазы, участвуя, таким образом, в пентозофосфат-ном цикле окисления глюкозы (в переносе альдегидной группы). Пиридоксин Фосфорилированная форма пиридоксина (витамина В6) - пиридоксальфосфат - является коферментом ряда ферментов, влияющих на все этапы неокислительного метаболизма аминокислот.

Являясь жирорастворимым производным тиамина (вита-мина В1), бенфотиамин всасывается быстрее и более полно, чем водорастворимый тиами-на гидрохлорид. Образующийся в кишечнике S-бензоилтиамин всасывается в основном не превращаясь в тиамин. Распределение S-бензоилтиамин жирорастворим, обладает высокой проникающей способностью.

ЕДИМ С ПОЛЬЗОЙ КОЛЛАГЕН КОМПЛЕКСНЫЙ  - Биологически активная добавка (БАД) к пище Производство коллагена в человеческом организме начинает снижаться примерно к 40 годам. Это приводит к появлению морщин, отвисанию и дряблости кожи, а также к изменениям в суставах, нарушающим полноценную двигательную активность. За счет достаточного количества коллагена поддерживается упругость кожи и ее молодость. Гидролизованный говяжий коллаген легко усваивается организмом. Синтез коллагена в организме не возможен без витамина C, поэтому препарат уже содержит аскорбиновую кислоту в нужных концентрациях в рекомендуемой дозе. Капсула состоит из коллагена в виде порошка, аскорбиновой кислоты, желатиновой оболочки. На коллаген приходится почти треть всех белков в человеческом организме. Входит в состав суставов, сухожилий, волос, ногтей, кожи, костей, зубов. Свойства: -улучшение качества кожи. Повышается упругость кожи, ее влажность и плотность; -снижение риска развития остеоартрита, облегчает восстановление после травм и снижает болевые ощущения в суставах; -улучшение силовых показателей. Увеличение мышечной массы, восстановление мышечных волокон; -укрепление стенок сосудов; -укрепление и увеличение роста волос и ногтей; -улучшение работы кишечника; -ускорение метаболизма помогает при борьбе с лишним весом.

Полученное соединение не вызывает никаких побочных эффектов, даже при концетрациях, в сотни раз превышающих предельно допустимые. Описание активных компонентов: Суточная потребность человека в селене составляет 80-200 мкг. Это очень небольшая доза. При условии ежедневного поступления такого количества, за всю жизнь суммарный объём не превысит и половины чайной ложки! И даже это небольшое количество, к сожалению, получить с современными продуктами питания невозможно. Наши почвы практически не содержат селена. В результате каждый второй житель России страдает дефицитом селена. Восполнить недостаток селена помогает препарат \\\"СЕЛЕН-АКТИВ\\\". Это абсолютно безопасное средство разработчики назвали - умным элементом. Все дело в том, что молекула препарата, в которую встроен селен, в зависимости от потребности организма может работать либо как источник селена для органов и тканей, либо как самостоятельный антиоксидант. «Селен-Актив» прошел клинические исследования в ГНИЦ профилактической медицины Минздрава РФ и НИИ питания РАМН. Результаты показали, что прием таблеток «Селен-Актив» у больных с ишемической болезнью сердца, артериальной гипертонией и нарушением липидного обмена в дополнение к терапии сердечно-сосудистыми препаратами приводит к уменьшению интенсивности окислительных процессов, снижению уровня холестерина и артериального давления. «Селен-Актив» рекомендован в качестве дополнительного источника селена и витамина С: для улучшения функционального состояния сердечно-сосудистой системы; в качестве средства для нормализации обмена холестерина; для повышения функциональной активности антиоксидантной системы организма.

Токоферола ацетат (витамин Е) обладает выраженным антиоксидантным действием, тормозит развитие свободно-радикальных реакций, предупреждает образование перекисей, повреждающих клеточные и субклеточные мембраны. Восстанавливает капиллярное кровообращение, нормализует тканевую проницаемость, повышает устойчивость тканей к гипоксии. Под влиянием витамина Е происходит синтез белков: коллагена в подкожной клетчатке и костях, сократительных белков в скелетных, гладких мышцах и миокарде, белков слизистых оболочек и плаценты, а также ферментов печени, креатинфосфокиназы, вазопрессиназы и гонадотропных гормонов. Витамин Е является эффективным иммуномодулятором, способствующим укреплению иммунозащитных сил организма. Витамины А и Е являются жирорастворимыми витаминами, обладают синергизмом - эффектом усиления биологической активности, более сильным, чем сумма действия при их раздельном применении. Наличие в составе продукта льняного масла способствует лучшему усвоению витаминов А и Е за счет содержащихся в масле полиненасыщенных жирных кислот (омега-3, омега-6). Регулярное поступление витаминов А и Е: • способствует профилактике регрессивных процессов глазных тканей и восстановлению нормального зрения; • улучшает структурно-функциональное состояние кожи и волос; • стимулирует деятельность половой системы и репродуктивных функций; • способствует профилактике атеросклероза и сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний; • нормализует обмен веществ и работу нервной системы; • повышает защитные силы организма.

Эйкозаноиды регулируют тонус гладкой мускулатуры, влияя на артериальное давление, состояние бронхов, кишечника, матки. Регулируют секрецию воды и натрия почками. Влияют на свёртываемость крови. Регулируют состояние слизистой оболочки желудка. Участвуют в формировании процесса воспаления при повреждении тканей и инфекции (боль, отёк, лихорадка). Некоторые эйкозаноиды являются нейромедиаторами и выполняют функцию гормонов. В организме эйкозаноиды синтезируются из жирных кислот семейства Омега-3 (важнейшие из которых альфа-линоленовая, докозагексаеновая, эйкозапентаеновая) и семейства Омега-6 (главные из которых линолевая и гамма-линоленовая). Количество и баланс этих кислот может серьёзно влиять на состояние здоровья человека. Чрезмерное потребление линолевой кислоты может привести к избыточной концентрации в организме воспалительных эйкозаноидов, которые способны сужать кровеносные сосуды, уменьшать просвет бронхов и повышать кровяное давление. Известный американский врач-кардиолог Роберт Аткинс в своей книге «Биодобавки доктора Аткинса: Природная альтернатива лекарствам при лечении и профилактике болезней» (Dr. Atkins Vita-Nutrient Solution: Nature's Answers to Drugs (1997) Simon and Schuster) упоминал, что смещение баланса в сторону воспалительных эйкозаноидов коррелирует с подавлением иммунной функции, раком и такими воспалительными заболеваниями, как астма и артрит. Для баланса необходима гамма-линоленовая кислота (ГЛК) - важный фактор стабилизации обменных процессов. Специальный фермент Дельта-6-Десатураза (Д6Д) преобразует жиры Омега-6 в ГЛК. У многих людей нет достаточного количества Д6Д. Способность к выработке данного фермента теряется с возрастом, активность его подавляется при потреблении большого количества сахара, алкоголя, гидрогенизированных масел. Кроме того, потерю этого фермента могут вызывать или усиливать диабет, гипотиреоз, вирусные инфекции. Для выработки Д6Д необходима помощь витаминов C, В3 и В6, а также, цинка и магния. Недостаток любого из этих веществ приводит к снижению выработки этого фермента в организме. Большое количество людей попадает в ту или иную категорию недостаточности Д6Д. Таким людям необходимо потреблять больше готовой гамма-линоленовой кислоты, которая редко, но встречается в природе в составе некоторых растительных масел, таких как масло энотеры (примулы вечерней), масло бурачника (огуречника), кедровое масло. В кедровом масле содержится, в среднем, около 20% гамма-линоленовой кислоты и около 60% линолевой кислоты. По содержанию витамина Е (токоферола) кедровое масло в 5 раз превосходит оливковое масло и в 3 раза кокосовое. Токоферолы являются антиоксидантами прямого действия, защищают ПНЖК и липиды клеточных мембран от перекисного окисления и повреждения свободными радикалами, регулируют обмен белков, жиров, углеводов, способствуют усвоению жиров, витаминов А и D. Также в состав кедрового масла входят витамины В1, В2, В3. «Омега 3-6-9» содержит в равных долях: - кедровое масло; - высокоочищенный рыбий жир, стабилизированный смесью натуральных токоферолов; - льняное масло. Кедровое масло выступает источником жирных кислот Омега-6, в том числе, самой ценной из них - ГЛК. Льняное масло и рыбий жир выступают источниками Омега-3 жирных кислот, основными из которых являются альфа-линоленовая, эйкозапентаеновая и докозагексаеновая. Омега-3 жирные кислоты концентрируются, в основном, в тканях мозга, зрительном аппарате, включаются в липидный бислой клеточных мембран, регулируя их микровязкость и проницаемость. Включение жирных кислот Омега-3 в рацион питания оказывает благоприятное комплексное воздействие на организм при: • повышенном риске развития сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний; • повышенной физической и нервно-психической нагрузке, стрессах; • профилактике простудных заболеваний; • сезонных депрессиях; • высоком холестерине; • восстановлении после перенесённых заболеваний; • ломкости волос и сухости кожи; • несбалансированном, неполноценном питании и в период соблюдения диет. Омега-9 - семейство ненасыщенных жирных кислот, которые не являются незаменимыми (эссенциальными) жирными кислотами в отличие от Омега-3 и Омега-6. Омега-9 кислоты могут быть синтезированы человеческим организмом. Кроме того, жирные кислоты Омега-9 являются распространёнными компонентами как животных жиров, так и растительных масел и, как правило, присутствуют в питании человека в достаточном количестве.

Содержание полиненасыщенных жирных кислот (ПНЖК) омега-3 в льняном масле почти вдвое выше, чем в рыбьем жире. Можно сказать, что льняное масло является «живым продуктом», поэтому его нужно оберегать от нагрева и  воздействия прямых солнечных лучей.  Желатиновая оболочка позволяет сохранить полезные свойства льняного масла, поэтому капсульная форма выпуска предпочтительнее  жидкой формы. Льняное масло предупреждает болезни сосудов и образование тромбов. Ежедневное употребление льняного масла способствует профилактике развития сердечных приступов, так как из-за уменьшения вязкости крови и нормализации уровня жиров в крови нагрузка на сердце снижается. Употребление в пищу ПНЖК способствует снижению показателей артериального давления. Льняное масло облегчает течение предменструального синдрома и пременопаузы, улучшает состояние кожи и волос, способствует заживлению повреждённых тканей.

Многочисленными клиническими исследованиями показано, что полиненасыщенные жирные кислоты Омега-3 положительно влияют на снижение липопротеинов  низкой плотности, нормализуют соотношение холестерина и триглицеридов в крови, что очень важно в борьбе с заболеваниями сердечно-сосудистой системы, в том числе атеросклерозом. Полиненасыщенные жирные кислоты Омега-3 тормозят процессы тромбообразования, обеспечивают поддержание иммунного статуса организма, нормализуют мозговое кровообращение, повышая устойчивость сосудов головного мозга при гипоксии и падении артериального давления, способствуют улучшению памяти, обладают противовоспалительным действием. Витамин Е предотвращает отложение холестерина в стенках сосудов, обеспечивает защиту клеток, предохраняет сердце от повреждений, связанных с дефицитом магния или с недостатком кислорода.

Антоцианы черники стимулируют синтез и естественное обновление зрительного пигмента родопсина, способствуя повышению остроты зрения, улучшению адаптации к темноте и условиям пониженной освещенности. При этом ускоряется процесс естественного обновления сетчатки и снижается усталость глаз от продолжительной работы. Комплекс биофлавоноидов черники и рутина с витамином C способствует укреплению сосудистой стенки, улучшению кровоснабжения глаз и поддержанию нормального внутриглазного давления. Комплекс витаминов группы B необходим для протекания нормальных метаболических процессов в тканях глаза. Витамин B1 повышает зрительную работоспособность, тогда как его недостаток вызывает мышечную слабость, в том числе тканей глаза. При дефиците витамина B2 наблюдается покраснение глаз, появляется чувство жжения в глазах и веках. При дефиците витамина B6 может наблюдаться повышенное напряжение и подергивание глаз. Цинк необходим для образования основного зрительного пигмента родопсина и проведения световых сигналов через сетчатку, благодаря чему он защищает глаза от структурных изменений, вызванных ярким светом, УФ-излучением или другими видами окислительного стресса. С дефицитом цинка в организме связывают структурные изменения сетчатки, снижение цветовосприятия. Таблетки круглой формы, без трещин и расслоений, покрытые оболочкой.

Действие: для повышения умственной работоспособности, уменьшения нервного и умственного напряжения, улучшения сна. Содержание в 2 таблетках (суточном приеме): Глицин, не менее 600 мг, что составляет 17% от адекватного уровня суточного потребления Пиридоксин (витамин B6), не более 6 мг, что составляет 300%* от адекватного уровня суточного потребления Тиамин (витамин B1), не более 5 мг, что составляет  357%* от адекватного уровня суточного потребления Витамин B12, не более 9 мкг, что составляет 900%* от адекватного уровня суточного потребления *Не превышает верхний допустимый уровень суточного потребления. Глицин Форте Эвалар отличается: 1. Высоким содержанием глицина (300 мг). В норме у человека преобладает влияние парасимпатической нервной системы (спокойствие), а при длительной нервной нагрузке баланс нарушается, и более активной становится симпатическая нервная система (активность). В результате повышенная активность, которая необходима человеку для решения конкретных задач, становится преобладающим состоянием перевозбуждения, которым сложно управлять. При этом снижается концентрация внимания, появляется чувство беспокойства, все труднее найти выход из сложной ситуации. Умственное напряжение, невозможность уснуть, расслабиться приводят к истощению нервной системы. С проблемой такого уровня сложно справиться самому. Во всем мире для решения этих проблем широко используется глицин - как нелекарственное средство, способствующее уменьшению стресса и умственного перенапряжения, причем в значительных количествах. 2. Действие глицина усилено витаминами B1, B6, B12 в таком соотношении, как они существуют в природе. Витамины группы В благотворно влияют на центральную и периферическую нервную систему, способствуют восстановлению поврежденных нервных волокон, помогают противодействовать стрессу. 3. Таблетки легко рассасываются, что способствует быстрому достижению эффекта: -повышению умственной работоспособности; -уменьшению нервного и умственного напряжения; -улучшению сна. Глицин Форте Эвалар не формирует зависимости при длительном приеме, поскольку содержит естественные для организма действующие компоненты. Специальные особенности: без сахара, без глютена, без ГМО.

Она заключается в том, что создаются биоподобные мицеллы, которые во много раз повышает всасывание полезных веществ организмом. Без них мы можем усвоить всего 10-15% витаминов и микроэлементов из пищи или биодобавки, а с помощью мицелл - 100%. «Витамин D3 2000 МЕ» (Micellar vitamin D3)  торговой  марки «Мицеллярные витамины (Micellar vitamins)» Биологически активная добавка (БАД) к пище - Мицеллированный Витамин D3 2000 МЕ содержит большое количество биологически активного вещества в одной капсуле.

Препарат рекомендован для обеспечения нормальной работы жизненно-важных органов и систем организма человека. Основное предназначение - это обеспечение прочности костей и зубов за счет регулирования фосфорно-кальциевого обмена. Прием препарата способствует усвоению и всасыванию кальция в кишечнике, запуску костного метаболизма, поддержанию кальция и фосфора в крови на необходимом уровне. При регулярном приеме препарата отмечается уменьшение вероятности развития рахита, укрепляются кости и зубы. Витамин D3 2000 МЕ благотворно влияет и на мышечную систему, укрепляет мышцы и обеспечивает нервно-мышечную проводимость, за счет чего снижается риск перелома костей. Прием препарата также рекомендован для повышения иммунитета, так как он запускает синтез антимикробных функций в организме. В целом прием препарата позволяет повысить тонус организма, снизить усталость, регулировать энергетический потенциал клеток. Также прием препарата оказывает благотворное влияние на деятельность нервной, бронхо-легочной, эндокринной, сердечно-сосудистой систем, повышает репродуктивную функцию. NovaSOL Витамин D3 Специальная технология NovaSOL позволяет многократно увеличить биодоступность основного действующего вещества, заключенного в микроскопических пищевых мицеллах с диаметром порядка 30 нм.

Железо относится к незаменимым микроэлементам необходимым для нормальной жизнедеятельности человека. При недостатке железа нарушается синтез гемоглобина, который выполняет важнейшую функцию в теле человека - транспорт кислорода к клеткам. Нормальное содержание железа важно для всех людей, но именно у женщин чаще всего наблюдается недостаток этого элемента вследствие регулярной ежемесячной потери крови, а также во время беременности, грудного вскармливания, в период роста и физического развития, полового созревания. Также в группу риска по дефициту железа входят и те, кто потребляет в больших количествах кофе, чай и другие напитки с кофеином.

Являясь жирорастворимым производным тиамина (витамина В1), бенфотиамин всасывается быстрее и более полно, чем водорастворимый тиамина гидрохлорид. В кишечнике бенфотиамин превращается в S-бензоилтиамин в результате дефосфорилирования фосфатазами. S-бензоилтиамин жирорастворим, обладает высокой проникающей способностью и всасывается в основном не превращаясь в тиамин. За счет ферментативного дебензоилирования после всасывания образуется тиамин и биологически активные коферменты тиамина дифосфат и тиамина трифосфат. Особенно высокие уровни данных коферментов наблюдаются в крови, печени, почках, мышцах и головном мозге. Пиридоксин (витамин В6) и его производные всасываются преимущественно в верхних отделах желудочно-кишечного тракта в ходе пассивной диффузии.

Передозировка, как правило, проявляется в виде развития сенсорной полинейропатии, которая может сопровождаться атаксией. Прием препарата в крайне высоких дозах может приводить к конвульсиям. На новорожденных и младенцев препарат может оказать сильное седативное действие, вызвать гипотонию и нарушения дыхания (диспноэ, апноэ). Лечение передозировки. При приеме пиридоксина в дозе, превышающей 150 мг/кг массы тела, рекомендуется вызвать рвоту и принять активированный уголь.

Продукция является уникальной благодаря особым технологиям, используемым при ее создании. Главное - это технология мицеллирования. Она заключается в том, что создаются биоподобные мицеллы, которые во много раз повышает всасывание полезных веществ организмом. Без них мы можем усвоить всего 10-15% витаминов и микроэлементов из пищи или биодобавки, а с помощью мицелл - 100%. «Мицеллярные витамины ADEK» («Micellar vitamins ADEK») - Биологически активная добавка (БАД) к пище - это витаминный комплекс, который содержит в себе витамины А, Е, D, К. Они улучшают обмен веществ, делают кожу лучше, укрепляют кости, зубы, волосы и ногти, способствуют повышению выносливости нервной системы, укрепляют мышцы. Улучшают циркуляцию крови, обеспечивают ее нормальную свертываемость, нормализуют работу мужской и женской репродуктивных систем. Витамины помогают при астме и диабете, очищают кровеносные сосуды от сгустков, защищают от остеопороза, способствуют правильному синтезу белка. Препарат улучшает свертываемость крови, применяется при травмах и ранениях, помогает вылечить язвенные болезни Препарат предназначен для восполнения дефицита витаминов А, Д, Е, К и при состояниях, требующих их повышенного поступления (спорт, изменения климатических условий, повышенные физические и эмоциональные нагрузки, прием препаратов или наличие заболеваний, вызывающих дефицит жирорастворимых витаминов, пожилой возраст).

Действующие вещества заключены в «продуктовые мицеллы» диаметром около 30 нм, которые являются основным компонентом солюбилизатов NovaSOL. Солюбилизаты устойчивы к кислотам (pH независимы), температуре и механическому воздействию, являются амфифильными (водо- и жирорастворимыми), имеют органическую формулу, исключающую наличие неорганических нано частиц (полностью метаболизируются в организме). Обладают повышенной биодоступностью и скоростью кишечного всасывания, ультратонким распределением. Имитируют природную структуру физиологических мицелл. Выводятся печенью и почками без повышения нагрузки на эти органы. Активные ингредиенты: -Витамин А осуществляет в организме две главные функции: способствует нормальному росту и развитию организма (принимает участие в синтезе стероидных гормонов (прогестерон), сперматогенезе, в окислительно-восстановительных процессах (синтез АТФ), регуляции синтеза белков, в формировании костей и зубов, необходим для роста новых клеток, замедляет процесс старения, способствует поддержанию постоянного уровня сахара в крови, помогая организму более эффективно использовать инсулин) и обеспечивает нормальное функционирование зрения, особенно сумеречного (входит в состав зрительных пигментов родопсина и йодопсина). Витамин А обеспечивает нормальное функционирование слезных, сальных, потовых желез и повышает устойчивость организма к инфекциям. Потребность в витамине А резко возрастает при повышении температуры окружающей среды и времени пребывания на солнце, при низкожировом питании. -Витамин Д регулирует фосфорно-кальциевый обмен (стимулирует выработку в кишечнике белка-носителя, необходимого для транспорта кальция, в почках и мышцах усиливает реабсорбцию кальция) и участвует в синтезе серотонина (отвечает за хорошее настроение и сон). От него зависит развитие костей, зубов, волос, качество мышечного сокращения, восприимчивость организма к кожным заболеваниям, болезням сердца и к раку. В странах, где пища бедна витамином Д, повышена заболеваемость атеросклерозом, артритами, диабетом, особенно 1 типа. Потребность в витамине Д возрастает при длительном пребывании в помещении, в более холодное время года, при низкожировом питании. -Витамин Е: препятствует тромбообразованию, участвует в синтезе гормонов, процессах тканевого дыхания, поддерживает иммунитет, обладает антиканцерогенным эффектом, обеспечивает нормальное функционирование мускулатуры и половых желез. Потребность в витамине Е увеличивается в более холодное время года и при низкожировом питании. -Витамин К: принимает участие в синтезе в печени протромбина (обеспечивает свертывание крови), участвует в обмене веществ в костях, соединительной ткани и работе почек. Рекомендации по применению: Для всех: • Повышенные физические, умственные нагрузки; • Вегетарианское питание; • Питание с пониженным содержанием жира; • Регулярный прием слабительных; • Прием препаратов с эстрогенами или андрогенами (тестостерон и его аналоги); • Нарушение сумеречного зрения («куриная слепота»); • Пожилой возраст; • Пребывание в очень жарком или очень холодном климате; • Нарушение сна; • Профилактика онкологии.

Незаменимые вещества необходимы для нормальной жизнедеятельности человека, но не синтезируются организмом или синтезируются в недостаточном количестве. Основным источником ДГК и ЭПК является рыбий жир, тогда как АЛК содержится преимущественно в растительных маслах. Потребность организма человека в ДГК и ЭПК намного выше, чем в АЛК, поэтому ДГК и ЭПК считаются основными веществами группы Омега-3 необходимыми человеку.

На протяжении десятилетий БИОСИЛ® дает людям по всему миру огромные преимущества в сохранении здоровья и красоты. Красота, юность и здоровье Взаимосвязь между красотой, молодостью и здоровьем (и это медицинский факт) очевидна. Основополагающим критерием этих аспектов является количество и качество коллагена в организме человека. Его название происходит от греческого слова kolla (клей), что в целом описывает основную функцию вещества - он составляет основу соединительной ткани организма. То есть, коллаген отвечает за нормальное функционирование кожи, волос, ногтей, костей, хрящей, кровеносной системы. Организм человека синтезирует коллаген самостоятельно, но с возрастом и под воздействием различных факторов данная способность нарушается, а запас белка начинает истощаться. В молодом возрасте его уровень достаточен, а структура имеет плотный сетчатый рисунок. Поэтому молодая кожа выглядит гладкой, увлажненной и упругой, ногти остаются крепкими и ровными, а волосы - густыми, сильными и блестящими, излучая здоровье и красоту и функционируя с максимальной эффективностью. Невозможно переоценить роль коллагена и в строении костей, ведь именно он увеличивает их минеральную плотность, придавая так необходимые им гибкость и прочность. Более того, коллаген является основным компонентом суставов, сухожилий, связок и хрящей. Также важна его роль в поддержании здоровья кровеносных сосудов, сердца, легких, почек и печени. Метаболизм коллагеновых волокон на фоне возрастных изменений После 21 года уровень коллагена и эластина начинает уменьшаться на 1-1,5% в год. Именно тогда коллагеновая «сетка» начинает разрушаться. Начиная с этого возраста женская кожа становится тоньше на 7% каждые 10 лет. Кроме этого, в течение первых 5-ти лет после наступления менопаузы содержание коллагена в организме снижается на 6% в год. Потеря коллагена снижает и минеральную плотность костей, приводя к их ломкости. УФ-лучи также являются существенным фактором, приводящим к снижению уровня коллагена в коже. Курение, стресс и плохое питание - все это также ведет к потере коллагена и эластина, в результате чего кожа становится тоньше. Потеря коллагена и эластина влияет и на правильное функционирование внутренних органов и зрения. Снижение уровня эстрогена и высокий уровень гомоцистеина также являются причиной расщепления коллагена в организме человека. Возможен ли синтез коллагена Как часто хочется вернуть что-то безнадежно потерянное! Это особенно актуально в отношении коллагена. И не удивительно - результаты двойных слепых плацебо-контролируемых клинических испытаний показывают существенное улучшение выработки коллагена у пациентов, принимающих БИОСИЛ®. Он действительно запускает процесс синтеза собственного коллагена, работая естественным образом. В организм не попадает ничего постороннего, он просто активизирует природные ферменты, генерирующие коллаген. Именно поэтому происходит выработка своего собственного, естественного коллагена, подобно тому, как это происходит в 18 лет. И это коллаген с отпечатком собственной ДНК! Кроме того, клинически доказано, что БИОСИЛ® абсолютно безопасен. Он позволяет вернуть утраченный, генерировать новый и защищать существующий коллаген от расщепления. Как защитить существующий и вновь сформированный коллаген от будущей потери БИОСИЛ® активирует ферменты, вырабатывающие коллаген, благодаря чему происходит восстановление утраченного и синтез нового. Но одной из особенностей, которые делают БИОСИЛ® поистине уникальным препаратом, является его способность защищать существующий и недавно полученный коллаген. Каким же образом? Вы наверняка слышали о гомоцистеине. Он является одной из важнейших аминокислот, которые входят в состав клеток нашего организма. Этот компонент участвует в общем метаболизме, обеспечивает нормальный кровоток, работу сердечно-сосудистой системы и безвреден при нормальных значениях. При его повышенном уровне происходит разрушение коллагена. Вот почему ученые часто называют его «антиколлагеновой» аминокислотой. Повышение уровня гомоцистеина в организме может быть результатом процесса старения или следствием менопаузы. Но есть и хорошие новости - активный ингредиент БИОСИЛ®, запатентованный комплекс ch-OSA® (стабилизированная холином ортокремниевая кислота) нейтрализует разрушительное действие гомоцистеина при его повышенном уровне. Это означает, что прием БИОСИЛ® дает возможность вырабатывать новый коллаген, защищая и существующий. Как доказана эффективность БИОСИЛ® Понятие «клинически проверенный» в научном мире не всегда базируется на серьезной доказательной базе. И тестирование препарата не означает, что результаты будут непременно положительными. Такие термины, как «клинические исследования» или «клиническая оценка» употребляются даже при проведении весьма неформальных тестов, в том числе, на малочисленных группах участников. Результаты часто выражаются «мнением», а не научными показателями. Золотой стандарт тестирования - двойное слепое рандомизированное плацебо-контролируемое клиническое исследование. Результаты таких испытаний должны быть рассмотрены как «статистически значимые» и опубликованы в рецензируемых медицинских журналах, прежде чем какие-либо факты могут быть предъявлены общественности. Именно этим стандартам следуют разработчики БИОСИЛ®. Как скоро станет видимым результат приема БИОСИЛ® БИОСИЛ® начинает работать с первого же дня приема, активируя вырабатывающие коллаген ферменты. И неважно, какова потеря коллагена на этот момент. Далее приведены результаты клинических испытаний БИОСИЛ® как в отношении поддержания здоровья и красоты. Результаты клинических исследований* Измерения в отношении кожи проводились через 20 недель, для волос - через 36 недель приема. БИОСИЛ® способствует • уменьшению тонких линий и морщин до 30% • повышению эластичности кожи до 89% • увеличению толщины волос до 12,8% • усилению крепости волос до 13,1% • видимому укреплению ногтевой пластины В отношении воздействия на костную ткань БИОСИЛ® помогает • повышать минеральную плотность костей при тестировании в критической области бедра до 2% • увеличить образование коллагена в костной ткани и суставах до 15% Данные клинические испытания включали измерение минеральной плотности костей и прирост в выработке коллагена в течение 365 дней приема (стандартный интервал для измерения значимого улучшения здоровья костной ткани). Приведенные результаты показывают улучшения, выходящие за рамки преимуществ от ежедневного приема 1000 мг кальция и 800 МЕ витамина D. *Приведены данные по отношению к показателям после приема плацебо. Результаты могут варьироваться. Какого эффекта ожидать Каждый человек индивидуален. Как быстро станут видимыми результаты приема БИОСИЛ®, зависит от целого ряда аспектов - возраст, генетика, рацион питания, образ жизни и так далее. Однако, есть средние временные рамки, которые принимают во внимание. Кожа Клинические испытания показали, что БИОСИЛ® уменьшает тонкие линии и морщины до 30% и делает кожу более эластичной до 89%. Это результаты измерений, сделанных после 20-ти недель приема. Но это не означает, что в течение этого времени не происходило никаких других улучшений. БИОСИЛ® начинает работать с первого же дня приема. Еще один аспект, характеризующий здоровое состояние кожи - степень ее увлажненности. Молодая кожа хорошо увлажнена, отличается упругостью и эластичностью. Такую гидратацию изнутри обеспечивает гликозаминогликаны - семейство молекул, которые вместе с волокнами коллагена и эластина образуют в тканях соединительный матрикс. По сути, они работают, как магниты, притягивающие влагу. Коллаген служит связующим звеном для этих увлажняющих молекул. Больше коллагена означает их большее количество. Вот почему возрастная потеря коллагена сопровождается уменьшением гликозаминогликанов и вызывает сухость кожи. БИОСИЛ® помогает восстановить утраченный, синтезировать новый и защитить существующий коллаген. Прием препарата прекрасно увлажняет кожу изнутри, делая ее более красивой, молодой и здоровой. Волосы Различия в темпах роста, состоянии и качестве волос у разных людей также объясняются возрастом, генетикой и влиянием окружающей среды. Однако, клинически доказано, что после 36-ти недель приема БИОСИЛ® толщина волос увеличивается до 12,8%, а крепость - до 13,1%. Прием препарата заставляет также волосы расти намного быстрее. Кроме густоты и силы, есть еще одно потрясающее преимущество, которое дает БИОСИЛ® - он придает волосам прекрасный блеск. Это неудивительно, поскольку он помогает накапливать в структуре волоса больше кератина, разглаживая его поверхность и делая ее более гладкой и светоотражающей. Ногти Как и волосы, ногти на 98% состоят из кератина. С годами его синтез в организме ослабевает. Вот почему ногти с возрастом чаще ломаются или трескаются. Слабость ногтей может быть и следствием нехватки витаминов. Но здоровые и крепкие ногти будут ровными и гладкими. Исследования показывают, что клинически подтвержденный комплекс ch-OSA® в БИОСИЛ® помогает улучшить структуру кератина в ногтях. Результат - более крепкие, ровные, красивые ногти. Улучшение состояния ногтей - первое преимущество, которое становится заметным после начала приема БИОСИЛ®. Это и есть видимое доказательство того, что препарат по-настоящему работает. Кости Клинические испытания БИОСИЛ® доказали, что его прием в сочетании с кальцием и витамином D всего за 1 год увеличивает минеральную плотность костной ткани на полные и клинически значимые 2%, а образование коллагена - до 15%. Для действительно крепких и здоровых костей требуется именно сочетание кальция и коллагена. Матрица коллагена служит связующим участком для всего костного кальция. Больше коллагена означает больше костных минералов. Еще более важно то, что он придает костям гибкость, необходимую для того, чтобы выдерживать нагрузки, например, сопротивление при внезапном ударе. Поддерживая их крепкими и упругими, можно сохранить энергию и активность на всю жизнь. БИОСИЛ®, помогает увеличить образование костного коллагена и усилить минеральную плотность костной ткани. Суставы Суставы представляют собой комбинацию из хрящей, связок, сухожилий и, конечно, костей. Но есть то, что связывает эти компоненты - все они почти полностью состоят из коллагена. Когда содержание коллагена уменьшается с возрастом или в результате травмы, суставы ослабевают. Коллаген снижает дегенеративность хрящевой ткани в случае остеоартрита, оказывая стимулирующий эффект на метаболизм протеогликанов в хрящевых клетках. Выработка коллагена оказывает поддержку здоровому функционированию суставов. Ученые, занимающиеся их изучением, называют коллаген их важнейшим структурным компонентом. Клинически доказано, что БИОСИЛ® способствует образованию коллагена в суставах. Именно поэтому большинство людей, принимающих БИОСИЛ® для лечения суставов, сообщают об улучшении уже в течение первых недель приема (наступление эффекта, однако, зависит от индивидуальных особенностей человека). В любом случае, БИОСИЛ® поможет вернуться к активному образу жизни, сделать вас более здоровыми и счастливыми! Почему недостаточно просто принимать коллаген, чтобы увеличить его уровень в организме В отличие от кальция, который можно принимать для увеличения его содержания в костной ткани, с коллагеном все не так просто. При приеме коллагена в виде таблеток, порошков, напитков или пептидов, организм воспринимает его не более, чем источник белка, расщепляя на аминокислоты и используя, прежде всего, в качестве источника пищи. Такова изначальная природа нашего орагнизма - поддерживать жизнь, а не красоту. Главная цель - синтез коллагена, а не увеличение его уровня за счет коллагеносодержащих препаратов. Но именно кремний способен сделать выработку коллагена наиболее эффективной. Поэтому и был создан БИОСИЛ® с комплексом стабилизированной холином ортокремниевой кислоты ch-OSA®, способный запустить процесс синтеза собственного коллагена. Что не менее важно, БИОСИЛ® не содержит каких-либо компонентов животного происхождения или морских организмов. Коллаген, который вы получаете с его помощью, вырабатывается естественным путем. Активируя производящие коллаген ферменты, БИОСИЛ® запускает процесс его синтеза в вашем организме. И вновь полученный коллаген будет иметь отпечаток вашей собственной ДНК! Как принимать БИОСИЛ® БИОСИЛ® можно принимать в любое удобное время, вне зависимости от приема пищи. БИОСИЛ® в жидкой форме можно просто добавить вместе с другими ингредиентами в блендер при смешивании любимого коктейля - бьюти-шейк БИОСИЛ® быстрого приготовления готов! Температура не влияет на эффективность БИОСИЛ®, поэтому его можно смешивать с горячим или холодным напитком. Можно ли принимать БИОСИЛ® вместе с другими пищевыми добавками Комбинированный прием с другими добавками никак не влияет на эффективность БИОСИЛ®. В любом случае, результат гарантирован. Можно ли принимать БИОСИЛ® вместе с лекарствами, отпускаемыми по рецепту Известных противопоказаний, которые запрещали бы принимать БИОСИЛ® с любыми лекарствами, отпускаемыми по рецепту, не существует. Однако, в качестве меры предосторожности, рекомендуем принимать БИОСИЛ® по крайней мере за час до или после приема любого лекарства, отпускаемого по рецепту или без него. Этика, ответственность и забота БИОСИЛ® - неоднократный и постоянный победитель в различных номинациях лучших препаратов для жизни вот уже более 10-ти лет. БИОСИЛ® создан при соблюдении самых высоких этических стандартов от разработки и до производства, при максимальном соблюдении принципов устойчивого развития. Компоненты продукта получены из возобновляемых источников, а сам препарат изготовлен на предприятии, использующем солнечную энергию, потребляющем минимальное количество воды и соответствующем нормам минимального выброса углерода. БИОСИЛ® - на 100% веганский препарат. Ни в оболочке капсул, ни в активных ингредиентах и вспомогательных веществах не используются компоненты животного происхождения. БИОСИЛ® - абсолютно безопасный и научно обоснованный продукт, созданный ведущими мировыми учеными, исследующими коллаген, и проверенный двойными слепыми плацебо-контролируемыми клиническими испытаниями.

Недостаток железа в пище - одна из основных причин железодефицитных состояний у детей. Симптомы дефицита железа в детском организме - это низкая сопротивляемость инфекциям, вялость, бледность, повышенная утомляемость, учащенное сердцебиение. Железо участвует в строительстве и функционировании важнейших систем детского организма. Дефицит железа в крови препятствует нормальному развитию ребёнка.

Описание компонентов: Полиненасыщенные кислоты Омега-3 (ПНЖК Омега-3) - необходимый элемент в образовании клеточных мембран тканей всего организма. Омега-3 - это группа полиненасыщенных жирных кислот, важнейшими из которых являются докозагексаеновая кислота (ДГК), эйкозапентаеновая кислота (ЭПК) и альфа-линоленовая кислота (АЛК), относящиеся к незаменимым (эссенциальным) веществам. Незаменимые вещества необходимы для нормальной жизнедеятельности человека, но не синтезируются организмом или синтезируются в недостаточном количестве. Основным источником ДГК и ЭПК является рыбий жир, тогда как АЛК содержится преимущественно в растительных маслах. Потребность организма человека в ДГК и ЭПК намного выше, чем в АЛК, поэтому ДГК и ЭПК считаются основными веществами группы Омега-3 необходимыми человеку. ПНЖК Омега-3 полезны при: • Повышенном риске развития сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний • Высоком холестерине • Профилактике простудных заболеваний • Хронических воспалительных процессах • Повышенной физической и нервно-психической нагрузке, стрессах • Беременности и кормлении грудью • Сезонных депрессиях • Ломкости волос и сухости кожи • В период восстановления после перенесенных заболеваний • При несбалансированном и неполноценном питании и в период соблюдения диет Пищевая и энергетическая ценность 1 капсулы массой 1500 мг: белки 0,3 г, жиры 1 г; 46 кДж/10 ккал;\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Показания\",\n        \"description\": \"в качестве биологически активной добавки к пище - дополнительного источника полиненасыщенных жирных кислот Омега-3, в том числе эйкозапентаеновой и докозагексаеновой кислот.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Противопоказания\",\n        \"description\": \"индивидуальная непереносимость компонентов.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Способ применения и дозы\",\n        \"description\": \"взрослым по 1 капсуле массой 1500 мг 1 раз в день во время еды.

Он не способен самостоятельно синтезироваться клетками организма человека, поэтому должен поступать в организм вместе с пищевыми продуктами в необходимом количестве. Он содержится в цитрусовых и многих овощах. Является важным питательным веществом в рационе человека, полезным для поддержания соединительной ткани и костей, считается антиоксидантом. Действие витамина С на организм выражается в восполнении его дефицита и улучшении системных функций. Он обладает антиатерогенными, антиканцерогенными, антигипертензивными, противовирусными, антигистаминными, иммуномодулирующими, офтальмо-защитными свойствами. Витамин С - мощный антиоксидант, он необходим для синтеза коллагена и является важной составляющей соединительных тканей, клеток крови, сухожилий, связок, хрящей, десен, кожи, зубов и костей. Он способствует усвоению организмом железа, является важным компонентом в метаболизме холестерина. Его польза и ценность очень велика для защиты организма от инфекций, способствует ускорению процессов восстановления после болезней. Витамин С действует как стимулятор запуска иммунных процессов. Витамин B2, известный также как рибофлавин, нормализует состояние нервной системы, устраняет негативное влияние стресса, улучшает тургор кожи, ускоряет рост волос, укрепляют ногти, улучшает гемоглобиновый показатель крови. Так же он восстанавливает остроту зрения, укрепляет иммунную защиту организма, усиливает активность мозга. Витамин B2 необходим для образования эритроцитов, антител, для регуляции роста и репродуктивных функций в организме.

Как работают ингредиенты Омега-6 (гамма-линоленовая кислота (ГЛК) - из кедрового масла, линолевая кислота (ЛК) - из льняного и кедрового масла) Особенно важным ингредиентом комплекса Омега 3-6-9 Супер от Эвалар является гамма-линоленовая кислота (ГЛК/GLA) - кислота из класса омега-6. Наличие ГЛК - это отличительная особенность кедрового масла. Несмотря на то, что ГЛК может синте зироваться в организме из линолевой кислоты, ее поступление с пищей чрезвычайно важно, так как со временем в организме снижается фермент, переводящий линолевую кислоту в ГЛК, и с возрастом этот процесс усиливается. ГЛК принимает участие в выработке гормоноподобных веществ - простагландин, которые помогают подавлять воспалительные, атопические1 и аутоиммунные процессы в организме. Существует несколько различных типов простагландинов, правильный баланс которых абсолютно необходим для того, чтобы организм был здоров. Простагландины, которые синтезируются из ГЛК, обладают выраженным противовоспалительным эффектом и являются важной частью клеточных мембран. Это и объясняет такое мощное действие ГЛК в борьбе с преждевременным старением, болезнями сердца, артритом, аллергиями. Кроме того, гипотензивное2, гипохолестеринемическое3, гиполипидемическое4, желчегонное и ранозаживляющее действие кедрового масла также связывают с активностью ГЛК в его составе. Омега-3 (эйкозапентаеновая кислота - из рыбьего жира, докозагексаеновая кислота - из рыбьего жира, альфа-линоленовая кислота - из льняного масла) Эйкозапентаеновая (ЭПК/EPA) и докозагексаеновая (ДГК/DHA) кислоты являются незаменимыми омега-3 жирными кислотами - то есть сами они не вырабатываются в организме. Низкий уровень этих кислот может вызвать серьезные проблемы со здоровьем. Они совершенно необходимы для многих функций организма, включая развитие и нормальное функционирование глаз и мозга. Исследования в области сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний показывают, что жители северных районов (эскимосы), которые в 10 раз меньше, по сравнению, например, с американцами, страдают сердечными заболеваниями. Также эскимосы реже заболевают раком, артритом, ожирением и диабетом. Это связывают с высоким потреблением жирной рыбы, богатой омега-3. У японцев, которые потребляют больше морских продуктов, чем американцы, также снижен уровень риска сердечных заболеваний. Современные исследования показывают, что омега-3 могут оказывать действие на артрит и псориаз, так как они обладают антивоспалительными свойствами. Прием их в больших дозах может снизить риск развития хронических воспалительных заболеваний. Кислоты класса омега-3 важны для работы всего организма, однако можно выделить ряд органов и систем, которым эти кислоты необходимы в первую очередь: • сердечно-сосудистая система • нервная система • иммунная система • органы зрения • кожа Омега-3 могут помочь снизить вязкость крови, улучшить кровоток, уменьшить уровень «плохого» холестерина, снижая тем самым вероятность образования тромбов, а также развития атеросклероза, ишемической болезни сердца, инфаркта и инсульта. Альфа-линоленовая кислота (АЛК/ALA) также является незаменимой омега-3 жирной кислотой. Ее основными источниками являются растительные масла, например, льняное. АЛК - главный компонент секрета сальных желез, обуславливающих защитное действие кожи. Омега-9 (олеиновая кислота - из льняного и кедрового масла) Наиболее важной из класса омега-9 кислот является олеиновая кислота (ОК/DA). Она присутствует в мембранах клеток и способствует поддержанию эластичности артерий и кожи. Также установлено, что в странах Средиземноморья, где в пищу употребляют большое количество оливкового масла, оливок, маслин, авокадо, орехов, относительно редко встречаются случаи сердечно-сосудистых и онкологических заболеваний. В большой степени это относится на счет омега-9 жирных кислот, присутствующих во всех этих пищевых продуктах. Признаки дефицита омега-9 в организме следующие: может развиваться общее или хроническое недомогание, от слабой усталости до сердечного приступа. Характерными признаками нехватки омега-9 в организме также является обострение сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний, повышение артериального давления, боли в суставах, артриты, ухудшение пищеварения, запоры, снижение иммунитета, частые простуды, ангина, депрессия, рассеянность, ухудшение памяти, усталость, недомогание, сухость кожи и слизистых, ломкие ногти, сухие, безжизненные волосы.

Омега-3 - группа полиненасыщенных жирных кислот, жизненно необходимых нашему организму. Всего в эту группу входит 11 разновидностей жирных кислот. Незаменимыми (не вырабатываются организмом в нужном объеме) являются лишь три: - альфа-линоленовая (АЛК), - эйкозапентаеновая кислота (ЭПК), - докозагексаеновая (ДГК). АЛК  является кислотой только растительного происхождения. А кислоты ЭПК и ДГК содержатся в рыбьем жире. Омега-3 для спорта Для получения хороших результатов в спорте необходима корректировка рациона питания. Помимо большого количества белка, витаминов и микроэлементов, в рацион важно добавить омега-3 жирные кислоты. Регулярное употребление омега-3 значительно улучшает метаболизм белка, помогает ему легче усвоиться, а значит, укреплять мышцы. Кроме того, одной из причин разрушения мышц является воспаление, с которым борется омега-3. Так как омега-3 жирные кислоты участвуют в формировании клеточных мембран, то за счет этого они позволяют сохранять эластичность сухожилий, связок, хрящей, способствуют улучшению свойств внутрисуставной смазки, замедляют распад коллагеновых волокон. Омега-3 снижают уровень «плохого» холестерина, защищают сосуды и капилляры, поддерживают общий тонус организма, что помогает повысить выносливость на тренировках. Кроме того, омега-3 жирные кислоты обеспечивают более быстрое восстановление после физических нагрузок и травм.

В основу таблеток «Йод-Актив» положен хорошо воспринимаемый человеком органический йод, который ученые встроили в молекулу молочного белка. Идею соединения йода с молоком для укрепления здоровья предложил русский ученый и священнослужитель отец Павел Флоренский. Это аналог природного соединения йода, которое мы начинаем получать уже с первыми каплями материнского молока. Уникальность таблеток «Йод-Актив» заключается в том, что это «умный йод»: при дефиците йода - он активно усваивается, а при избытке - выводится из организма, не поступая в щитовидную железу. Это происходит благодаря тому, что йод отщепляется от молочного белка под действием ферментов печени, которые вырабатываются при недостатке йода. Когда йода в организме достаточно, ферменты не вырабатываются и «Йод-Актив» выводится естественным путем, не всасываясь в кровь. таблетки Пищевая ценность суточной дозы 1 -2 таблетки, содержание йода - 50 -100 мкг (% от рекомендуемого уровня суточного потребления): дети от 5 до 7 лет - 50 -100%, дети от 7 до 11 лет - 42 - 84%, дети от 11 до 14 лет-39-77%, дети от 14 лет и взрослые-33-67%.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Показания\",\n        \"description\": \"Йод-Актив» - дополнительный источник йода, рекомендуется: для преодоления йодного дефицита; для профилактики заболеваний, связанных с дефицитом йода; для нормализации функции щитовидной железы.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Противопоказания\",\n        \"description\": \"индивидуальная непереносимость компонентов продукта, лицам с заболеваниями щитовидной железы, при которых противопоказаны препараты йода.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Способ применения и дозы\",\n        \"description\": \"детям с 5 лет и взрослым по 1-2 таблетки 1 раз в день во время еды.

По сравнению с витамином D2 характеризуется на 25 % более высокой активностью. Витамин D связывается со специфическим рецептором витамина D (VDR), который регулирует экспрессию многих генов, включая гены ионного канала TRPV6 (обеспечивает абсорбцию кальция в кишечнике), CALB1 (кальбиндин; обеспечивает транспорт кальция в кровеносное русло), BGLAP (остеокальцин; обеспечивает минерализацию костной ткани и гомеостаз кальция), SPP1 (остеопонтин; регулирует миграцию остеокластов), REN (ренин; обеспечивает регуляцию артериального давления, являясь ключевым элементом ренин-ангиотензин-альдостероновой системы регуляции), IGFBP (связывающий белок инсулинподобного фактора роста; усиливает действие инсулинподобного фактора роста), FGF23 и FGFR23 (фактор роста фибробластов 23; регулируют уровни кальция, фосфат-аниона, процессы клеточного деления фибробластов), TGFB1 (трансформирующий фактор роста бета-1; регулирует процессы клеточного деления и дифференцировки остеоцитов, хондроцитов, фибробластов и кератиноцитов), LRP2 (ЛПНП-рецептор-связанный белок 2; является посредником эндоцитоза липопротеинов низкой плотности), INSR (рецептор инсулина; обеспечивает эффекты инсулина на любые типы клеток). Витамин D3 является активным антирахитическим фактором. Самой важной функцией витамина D3 является регулирование метаболизма кальция и фосфатов, что способствует правильной минерализации и росту скелета. Колекальциферол играет существенную роль в абсорбции кальция и фосфатов в кишечнике, в транспорте минеральных солей и в процессе кальцификации костей, регулирует также выведение кальция и фосфатов почками. Концентрация ионов кальция в крови обуславливает поддержание тонуса мышц скелетной мускулатуры, функцию миокарда, способствует проведению нервного возбуждения, регулирует процесс свертывания крови. Недостаток витамина D в пище, нарушение его всасывания, дефицит кальция, а также недостаточное пребывание на солнце в период быстрого роста ребенка приводит к рахиту, у взрослых ? к остеомаляции, у беременных могут возникнуть симптомы тетании, нарушение процессов обызвествления костей новорожденных. Повышенная потребность в витамине D возникает у женщин в период менопаузы, поскольку у них часто развивается остеопороз в связи с гормональными нарушениями. Витамин D обладает рядом т.н. внескелетных эффектов. Витамин D участвует в функционировании иммунной системы путем модуляции уровней цитокинов и регулирует деление лимфоцитов Т-хелперов и дифференцировку В-лимфоцитов. В ряде исследований отмечено снижение заболеваемости инфекциями дыхательных путей на фоне приема витамина D. Показано, что витамин D является важным звеном гомеостаза иммунной системы: предотвращает аутоиммунные заболевания (сахарный диабет 1 типа, рассеянный склероз, ревматоидный артрит, воспалительные болезни кишечника и др.). Витамин D обладает антипролиферативным и продифференцирующим эффектами, которые обуславливают онкопротективное действие витамина D. Отмечено, что частота некоторых опухолей (рак молочной железы, рак толстого кишечника) повышается на фоне низкого уровня витамина D в крови. Витамин D участвует в регуляции углеводного и жирового метаболизма путем влияния на синтез IRS1 (субстрат рецептора инсулина 1; участвует во внутриклеточных путях проведения сигнала рецептора инсулина), IGF (инсулинподобный фактор роста; регулирует баланс жировой и мышечной ткани), PPAR-? (активированный рецептор пролифераторов пероксисом, тип ?; способствует переработке избыточного холестерина). По данным эпидемиологических исследований дефицит витамина D ассоциирован с риском метаболических нарушений (метаболический синдром и сахарный диабет 2 типа). Рецепторы и метаболизирующие ферменты витамина D экспрессируются в артериальных сосудах, сердце и практически всех клетках и тканях, имеющих отношение к патогенезу сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний. На животных моделях показаны антиатеросклеро-тическое действие, супрессия ренина и предупреждение повреждения миокарда и др.

В исследованиях на экспериментальных моделях болезни Альцгеймера показано, что витамин D3 снижал накопление амилоида в мозге и улучшал когнитивную функцию. В неитервенционных исследованиях у человека показано, что частота развития деменции и болезни Альцгеймера увеличивается на фоне низкого уровня витамина D и низкого диетарного потребления витамина D.

Под термином «витамин D» понимают целую группу биологически активных веществ, куда входят инертный витамин D, получаемый из пищи (D2 - эргокальциферол) и синтезированный в коже (D3 - холекальциферол). Попадая в печень и почки, витамин D превращается в активный и очень важный метаболит - кальцитриол, обеспечивающий основные биологические эффекты витамина D. Оказывая многообразные биологические эффекты за счет взаимодействия со специфическими рецепторами в клетках многих тканей и органов, витамин D ведет себя как истинный гормон. Именно поэтому он получил второе название D-гормон. Основное количество витамина D образуется в коже под действием ультрафиолетовых лучей солнца. Образование витамина D идет особенно активно летом, в солнечную погоду. Содержание же витамина D в продуктах питания довольно низкое и не может покрыть потребностей организма в этом веществе. Наибольшее количество витамина D содержится в морской рыбе, рыбьем жире, яичных желтках, печени, коровьем молоке. Грудное молоко кормящих матерей, не получающих добавки, содержащие витамин D, имеет лишь небольшое количество витамина D, совершенно недостаточное для нормального развития новорожденного ребенка. Согласно оценкам ученых, дефицит витамина D широко распространен во всех возрастных группах. Этому способствует образ жизни человека в современных условиях. Очень немногие натуральные продукты содержат витамин D, лишь некоторые из пищевых продуктов дополнительно им обогащаются. Целый ряд факторов снижает производство кожного витамина D, в том числе повышенная пигментация кожи, её старение и применение солнцезащитных средств. Влияет и география: в широтах, расположенных выше широты 33°, синтез витамина D в коже очень низок или совсем отсутствует в течение большей части года. Нахождение в тени и облачная погода способны сократить синтез провитамина на 60%. Через стекло, одежду и крем от загара ультрафиолет, необходимый для синтеза провитамина, не проникает. Витамин D3 и его роль в организме Витамин D3 и костная ткань В первую очередь, витамин D3 участвует в регуляции обмена кальция и фосфора в организме. Он отвечает за всасывание этих микроэлементов из пищи в тонком кишечнике, а также активирует процесс встраивания кальция в костную ткань, активно способствует росту скелета, минерализации костей и зубов и укреплению мышц. Многочисленные исследования показали, что дополнительный прием витамина D3 повышает минеральную плотность кости и позвоночника, на 46% снижает частоту переломов шейки бедра и на 32% - всех других видов переломов. Витамин D3 и сердце Витамину D3 отводится важное значение в способности организма противодействовать болезням сердца. Существуют данные, свидетельствующие о том, что низкие уровни активного метаболита витамина D могут быть связаны с ускоренным развитием сердечно сосудистых заболеваний. Исследования показали обратную зависимость между уровнями витамина D и активностью ренина в плазме, артериальной гипертензией и кальцификацией коронарных артерий. По результатам многолетних наблюдений оказалось что люди, испытывавшие в детстве дефицит витамина D, в зрелом возрасте чаще страдали атеросклерозом, который провоцировал развитие ишемических заболеваний сердечно сосудистой системы. Низкие уровни витамина D были также связаны с фатальными инсультами, сердечной недостаточностью, внезапной кардиальной смертью и кальцинированным аортальным стенозом. Кардиологи уверены, что прием витамина D - простейшая профилактика сердечно-сосудистых проблем. Витамина D3 и онкология Витамин D3 активно противостоит онкологическим заболеваниям. Доказано, что у людей с достаточным уровнем витамина D3 в организме риск онкологических заболеваний, таких как рак молочной железы или рак кишечника, на 50% ниже, чем у людей дефицитом витамина D3. Исследования показали, что восполнение дефицита D3 при уже имеющемся онкологическом процессе оказывает положительное влияние на течение заболевания. Ученые утверждают, что шансы на выживаемость при высоком уровне витамина D у раковых больных значительно возрастают. Витамин D и сахарный диабет После открытия в бета-клетках поджелудочной железы витамин-D-рецепторов (VDR) началось активное изучение роли дефицита витамина D в развитии сахарного диабета 2 типа. Доказано, что дефицит витамина D снижает секрецию инсулина бета-клетками поджелудочной железы и увеличивает инсулинорезистентность - нечувствительность тканей к инсулину. Другие эффекты витамина D Отмечено также влияние кальциферола на мускулатуру (предупреждает слабость мышц) и иммунитет (повышает сопротивляемость организма инфекциям). Недаром при оценке предполагаемой продолжительности жизни больного СПИДом одним из важных показателей является уровень содержания в крови витамина D. Используют витамин D и при комплексном лечении рассеянного склероза. Здесь, благодаря свойству стимулировать усвоение магния и кальция, он восстанавливает защитную оболочку нерва, нормализует передачу нервных импульсов и процесс сокращения мышц. Таким образом, восполнение дефицита витамина D с помощью препаратов витамина D в настоящее время является практически необходимым условием достижения и поддержания нормальной концентрации кальцитриола в сыворотке крови. Согласно рекомендациям международных экспертов, для профилактики и лечения дефицита витамина D применяется холекальциферол, или витамин D3. Согласно Клиническим рекомендациям Российской ассоциации эндокринологов (2015) с целью профилактики дефицита витамина D у взрослых рекомендуется: -Лицам в возрасте 18-50 лет - получать не менее 600-800 МЕ витамина D в сутки. -Лицам старше 50 лет - не менее 800-1000 МЕ витамина D в сутки. -Беременным и кормящим женщинам -  не менее 800-1200 МЕ витамина D в сутки. -Для поддержания уровня 25(ОН)D более 30 нг/мл может потребоваться потребление не менее 1500-2000 МЕ витамина D в сутки. -Пациенты с ожирением нуждаются в увеличении дозы витамина D в 2-3 раза - до 4000-6000 МЕ витамина D в сутки. -При заболеваниях/состояниях, сопровождающихся нарушением всасывания/метаболизма витамина D, рекомендуется прием витамина D в дозах в 2-3 раза превышающих суточную потребность возрастной группы. -Без медицинского наблюдения и контроля уровня 25(ОН)D в крови не рекомендуется назначение доз витамина D более 10 000 МЕ в сутки на длительный период (> 6 месяцев).\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Показания\",\n        \"description\": \"в качестве биологически активной добавки к пище - источника витамина Д3.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"header\": \"Противопоказания\",\n        \"description\": \"Гиперкальциемия, индивидуальная непереносимость компонентов продукта.

Омега 3 - это группа веществ, основные из которых:альфа-линоленовая кислота (АЛК), докозагексаеновая кислота (ДГК), эйкозапентаеновая кислота (ЭПК). «Омега-3 концентрат 60%» помогает восполнить недостаток ПНЖК омега-3 в Вашем питании благодаря повышенному содержанию омега-3 жирных кислот (ЭПК, ДГК). Для сравнения: в рыбьем жире содержится, как правило, от 10 до 35% омега-3 (ЭПК, ДГК), в льняном масле - примерно 50% омега-3 (АЛК). В сравнении с омега-3 льняного масла, омега-3 рыбьего жира быстрее и легче включаются в обменные процессы организма человека. Краткая характеристика жирных кислот: Насыщенные и мононенасыщенные - в основном, животные жиры (поступают с пищей, синтезируются организмом); Омега-6 - в большинстве растительные жиры. Поступают с пищей, могут синтезироваться организмом, за исключением линолевой кислоты; Омега-3 - растительные жиры (АЛК) и рыбий жир (ДГК,ЭПК). В основном поступают с пищей (орехи, льняное масло, жирная рыба). Кроме участия в строительстве клеток, ПНЖК омега-3 также обладают широким спектром физиологических эффектов, поскольку являются исходным материалом для образования важных сигнальных молекул - эйкозаноидов. Эйкозаноиды осуществляют контроль над физиологическими системами тела, регулируя процессы воспаления, иммунного ответа и передачи сигналов в нервной системе. ПНЖК омега-3 Для нервной системы: - ускоряют передачу нервных импульсов; - предотвращают депрессивные состояния. Для мозга: - улучшают память; - повышают концентрацию внимания; - снижают риск развития старческого слабоумия. Во время беременности и кормления грудью: - необходимы для полноценного развития мозга, нервной системы, органов зрения ребенка. Для сердца и сосудов: -снижают уровень холестерина; - снижают риск образования тромбов; - поддерживают тонус кровеносных сосудов и бронхов; - улучшают состояние сосудов; - нормализуют кровяное давление. Для иммунитета: - уменьшают воспалительные процессы; - уменьшают аллергические реакции; - улучшают состояние слизистых оболочек; - повышают иммунный статус. Для красоты и молодости: - помогают сохранить здоровье кожи, волос, ногтей; - нормализуют процессы регенерации клеток и процессы секреции; - нормализуют обмен веществ; - ускоряют липолиз (сжигание жиров); - повышают выносливость. Для кожи -уменьшение симптомов заболеваний кожи (дерматиты, экземы, псориаз) При занятиях спортом -способствуют набору мышечной массы; -повышают выносливость; -ускоряют липолиз (сжигание жиров). ПНЖК омега-3 полезны: -для профилактики и в комплексной терапии сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний; -при сниженной умственной и физической работоспособности; -при повышенном уровне холестерина; -беременным и кормящим женщинам; -часто болеющим людям; -при повышенной нервной возбудимости; -при хронических воспалительных процессах; -в преклонном возрасте для поддержания здоровья. ПНЖК омега-3 необходимы для нормального функционирования организма человека. Однако, современный человек, как правило, потребляет пищу с низким содержанием омега-3. При недостаточном поступлении омега-3 в организм человека происходит замещение недостающих ПНЖК производными других жирных кислот. Эти изменения, в конечном итоге, могут привести к серьезным нарушениям в работе иммунной системы, внутренних органов, нарушению зрительной и репродуктивной функций и т.п. Таким образом, достаточное поступление с пищей ПНЖК омега-3 является важным условием поддержания здоровья.

В среднем, в теле человека содержится около 1 кг кальция, примерно 99% находится в скелете. Кальцию присущ ряд важнейших функций в организме: • Формирование костной ткани, дентина и эмали зубов; • Участие в процессах сократимости мышц, нервной и нервно-мышечной проводимости; • Обеспечение оптимальных условий свертывания крови; • Регуляция проницаемости стенок сосудов; • Поддержание кислотно-щелочного баланса организма; • Активация ряда ферментов и функции некоторых эндокринных желез; Кальций важен для стабильной сердечной деятельности, выработки ряда гормонов, метаболизма адипоцитов (клеток жировой ткани), способствуя, более эффективной потере жировой ткани при похудании/соблюдении диеты, для лучшего контроля веса. Адекватное потребление кальция особенно важно в период роста, беременности и грудного вскармливания. Витамин Д3 (колекальциферол) - относится к группе жирорастворимых витаминов. Способствует всасыванию кальция в кишечнике и поддерживает необходимые уровни кальция и фосфатов в крови для обеспечения минерализации костной ткани. Он также необходим для роста костей и процесса костной перестройки. Достаточный уровень витамина Д предотвращает развитие рахита у детей и нарушений минерализации костной ткани у взрослых. Применение кальция и витамина Д3 препятствует увеличению выработки паратиреоидного гормона (ПТГ), который является стимулятором повышенной костной резорбции (вымывания кальция из костей). Вместе с кальцием витамин Д применяется для снижения риска развития и в составе комплексного лечения остеопороза. Функции витамина Д не ограничены только контролем кальций-фосфорного обмена, он также влияет и на другие физиологические процессы в организме, участвуя в модуляции функций иммунной системы, важен для поддержания репродуктивного здоровья, участвует в поддержании нормальной работы сердечно-сосудистой системы, метаболизме жиров, глюкозы и инсулина, а также регулирует развитие и функционирование структур нервной системы. Низкий уровень витамина Д может предшествовать возрастным когнитивным нарушениям и нейродегенеративным заболеваниям. По данным научных исследований: К наиболее распространенным патологическим состояниям, связанным с дефицитом кальция, могут быть отнесены остеопения (состояние, при котором отмечается уменьшение минеральной плотности костей (МПК) и массы костной ткани) и остеопороз, сопряженные с повышенным риском переломов костей и других травм опорно-двигательного аппарата. В настоящее время есть работы, которые показывают, что прием добавок кальция и витамина Д связан со снижением изменений МПК и переломов. Ряд крупных клинических исследований показали, что дополнительный прием кальция и витамина Д связан со снижением риска переломов и потери костной массы. Также, доказано, что недостаточное поступление кальция, приводит к образованию неполноценных по структуре и свойствам кристаллов гидроксиапатитов в твердых тканях зубов, что снижет резистентность зубов к кариесу, а также к возникновению дефектов эмали зубов. Результаты вышеуказанных научных работ указывают на важную роль кальция и витамина Д в поддержании оптимального здоровья костей и зубов.

Это приводит к появлению морщин, отвисанию и дряблости кожи, а также к изменениям в суставах, нарушающим полноценную двигательную активность. За счет достаточного количества коллагена поддерживается упругость кожи и ее молодость. Гидролизованный говяжий коллаген легко усваивается организмом. Синтез коллагена в организме не возможен без витамина C, поэтому препарат уже содержит аскорбиновую кислоту в нужных концентрациях в рекомендуемой дозе. Капсула состоит из коллагена в виде порошка, аскорбиновой кислоты, желатиновой оболочки. На коллаген приходится почти треть всех белков в человеческом организме. Входит в состав суставов, сухожилий, волос, ногтей, кожи, костей, зубов. Свойства: -улучшение качества кожи. Повышается упругость кожи, ее влажность и плотность; -снижение риска развития остеоартрита, облегчает восстановление после травм и снижает болевые ощущения в суставах; -улучшение силовых показателей. Увеличение мышечной массы, восстановление мышечных волокон; -укрепление стенок сосудов; -укрепление и увеличение роста волос и ногтей; -улучшение работы кишечника; -ускорение метаболизма помогает при борьбе с лишним весом.

Нормализует проницаемость капилляров, участвует в синтезе коллагена, благодаря чему поддерживает в здоровом состоянии кровеносные сосуды, кожу. Пантотеновая кислота (В5) участвует в углеводном и жировом обмене, ускоряет процессы регенерации, участвует в передаче нервных импульсов. Недостаток витамина В5 может вызывать дерматит, приводить к нарушению роста волос и преждевременной  седине. Витамин В6 (пиридоксин) участвует в обмене веществ; необходим для нормального функционирования центральной и периферической нервной системы, необходим для поддержания оптимального состояния кожи, волос, ногтей.  Дефицит витамина В6 может проявляться сухим себорейным дерматитом (в том числе волосистой части головы), тошнотой, потерей аппетита, стоматитом. Витамин А (ретинол) участвует в формировании зрительных пигментов, необходим для сумеречного и цветового зрения, для роста костей, нормальной репродуктивной функции, обеспечивает целостность эпителиальных тканей, защищает кожу от УФ-излучения. Обладает антиоксидантными свойствами (защищает клеточные структуры от повреждения свободными радикалами). Способствует поддержанию нормальной функции кожи, волос и ногтей. Дефицит в рационе может проявляться сухостью кожи и волос, тусклостью и ломкостью волос и ногтей. Витамин Е (α-токоферола ацетат) обладает выраженной антиоксидантной активностью, защищает клетки и ткани организма от повреждающего воздействия активных форм кислорода; предупреждает гемолиз эритроцитов; оказывает положительное влияние на функции половых желез, нервной и мышечной ткани. Биотин участвует в обмене углеводов и жиров. Играет важную роль в поддержании оптимального обмена веществ в коже, волосах и ногтях. Недостаточное поступление биотина в организм приводит к выпадению волос и шелушению кожи. Цинк входит в состав основных ферментов, участвует в различных биохимических реакциях; в стабилизации клеточных мембран; обладает иммуномодулирующими свойствами, способствует усвоению витамина А, регенерации кожи и росту волос. Медь способствует антиоксидантной защите клеток, участвует в синтезе коллагена, предупреждает анемию и кислородное голодание органов и тканей, способствует снижению риска развития остеопороза. Укрепляет стенки сосудов. Дефицит меди в организме способствует появлению ранней седины. Марганец необходим для нормального роста, обмена веществ, процессов остеогенеза, углеводного и липидного обмена. Влияет на развитие костной ткани, участвует в тканевом дыхании, иммунных реакциях. Принимает участие в синтезе меланина. Инозит - витаминоподобное вещество. Принимает активное участие в формировании мембранных структур клеток и внутриклеточных образований. Недостаток инозита в организме способствует проявлению таких процессов как: выпадение волос; нарушения функции зрения, координации движений, нормального функционирования печени, состояния кожи. Биологически активные вещества сухого экстракта плодов серенои ползучей (карликовой пальмы), в том числе бета-ситостерол, способствуют снижению активности воздействия андрогенных гормонов (таких как дигидротестостерон, блокирующий факторы роста волос) на специфические рецепторы в волосяных фолликулах, что существенно ослабляет процесс потери волос и способствует их росту.

Эйкозаноиды регулируют тонус гладкой мускулатуры, влияя на артериальное давление, состояние бронхов, кишечника, матки. Регулируют секрецию воды и натрия почками. Влияют на свёртываемость крови. Регулируют состояние слизистой оболочки желудка. Участвуют в формировании процесса воспаления при повреждении тканей и инфекции (боль, отёк, лихорадка). Некоторые эйкозаноиды являются нейромедиаторами и выполняют функцию гормонов. В организме эйкозаноиды синтезируются из жирных кислот семейства Омега-3 (важнейшие из которых альфа-линоленовая, докозагексаеновая, эйкозапентаеновая) и семейства Омега-6 (главные из которых линолевая и гамма-линоленовая). Количество и баланс этих кислот может серьёзно влиять на состояние здоровья человека. Чрезмерное потребление линолевой кислоты может привести к избыточной концентрации в организме воспалительных эйкозаноидов, которые способны сужать кровеносные сосуды, уменьшать просвет бронхов и повышать кровяное давление. Известный американский врач-кардиолог Роберт Аткинс в своей книге «Биодобавки доктора Аткинса: Природная альтернатива лекарствам при лечении и профилактике болезней» (Dr. Atkins Vita-Nutrient Solution: Nature's Answers to Drugs (1997) Simon and Schuster) упоминал, что смещение баланса в сторону воспалительных эйкозаноидов коррелирует с подавлением иммунной функции, раком и такими воспалительными заболеваниями, как астма и артрит. Для баланса необходима гамма-линоленовая кислота (ГЛК) - важный фактор стабилизации обменных процессов. Специальный фермент Дельта-6-Десатураза (Д6Д) преобразует жиры Омега-6 в ГЛК. У многих людей нет достаточного количества Д6Д. Способность к выработке данного фермента теряется с возрастом, активность его подавляется при потреблении большого количества сахара, алкоголя, гидрогенизированных масел. Кроме того, потерю этого фермента могут вызывать или усиливать диабет, гипотиреоз, вирусные инфекции. Для выработки Д6Д необходима помощь витаминов C, В3 и В6, а также, цинка и магния. Недостаток любого из этих веществ приводит к снижению выработки этого фермента в организме. Большое количество людей попадает в ту или иную категорию недостаточности Д6Д. Таким людям необходимо потреблять больше готовой гамма-линоленовой кислоты, которая редко, но встречается в природе в составе некоторых растительных масел, таких как масло энотеры (примулы вечерней), масло бурачника (огуречника), кедровое масло. В кедровом масле содержится, в среднем, около 20% гамма-линоленовой кислоты и около 60% линолевой кислоты. По содержанию витамина Е (токоферола) кедровое масло в 5 раз превосходит оливковое масло и в 3 раза кокосовое. Токоферолы являются антиоксидантами прямого действия, защищают ПНЖК и липиды клеточных мембран от перекисного окисления и повреждения свободными радикалами, регулируют обмен белков, жиров, углеводов, способствуют усвоению жиров, витаминов А и D. Также в состав кедрового масла входят витамины В1, В2, В3. «Омега 3-6-9» содержит в равных долях: - кедровое масло; - высокоочищенный рыбий жир, стабилизированный смесью натуральных токоферолов; - льняное масло. Кедровое масло выступает источником жирных кислот Омега-6, в том числе, самой ценной из них - ГЛК. Льняное масло и рыбий жир выступают источниками Омега-3 жирных кислот, основными из которых являются альфа-линоленовая, эйкозапентаеновая и докозагексаеновая. Омега-3 жирные кислоты концентрируются, в основном, в тканях мозга, зрительном аппарате, включаются в липидный бислой клеточных мембран, регулируя их микровязкость и проницаемость. Включение жирных кислот Омега-3 в рацион питания оказывает благоприятное комплексное воздействие на организм при: • повышенном риске развития сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний; • повышенной физической и нервно-психической нагрузке, стрессах; • профилактике простудных заболеваний; • сезонных депрессиях; • высоком холестерине; • восстановлении после перенесённых заболеваний; • ломкости волос и сухости кожи; • несбалансированном, неполноценном питании и в период соблюдения диет. Омега-9 - семейство ненасыщенных жирных кислот, которые не являются незаменимыми (эссенциальными) жирными кислотами в отличие от Омега-3 и Омега-6. Омега-9 кислоты могут быть синтезированы человеческим организмом. Кроме того, жирные кислоты Омега-9 являются распространёнными компонентами как животных жиров, так и растительных масел и, как правило, присутствуют в питании человека в достаточном количестве.

Биологически активные вещества черники (антоцианы, органические кислоты, каротины, пектиновые вещества, микроэлементы), действующие в комплексе с витаминами группы В, витамином С, рутином и цинком: •\\tспособствуют снятию напряжения с глаз и сохранению зрения; •\\tзащищают глаза от усталости и раздражения; •\\tспособствуют улучшению адаптации зрения в темноте и укреплению стенок кровеносных сосудов, в том числе сосудов глазного дна;•\\tоказывают положительное влияние на функциональное состояние органов зрения, связанное с дефицитом витаминов и микроэлементов. Антоцианы черники стимулируют синтез и естественное обновление зрительного пигмента родопсина, способствуя повышению остроты зрения, улучшению адаптации к темноте и условиям пониженной освещенности. При этом ускоряется процесс естественного обновления сетчатки и снижается усталость глаз от продолжительной работы. Комплекс биофлавоноидов черники и рутина с витамином C способствует укреплению сосудистой стенки, улучшению кровоснабжения глаз и поддержанию нормального внутриглазного давления. Комплекс витаминов группы B необходим для протекания нормальных метаболических процессов в тканях глаза. Витамин B1 повышает зрительную работоспособность, тогда как его недостаток вызывает мышечную слабость, в том числе тканей глаза. При дефиците витамина B2 наблюдается покраснение глаз, появляется чувство жжения в глазах и веках. При дефиците витамина B6 может наблюдаться повышенное напряжение и подергивание глаз. Цинк необходим для образования основного зрительного пигмента родопсина и проведения световых сигналов через сетчатку, благодаря чему он защищает глаза от структурных изменений, вызванных ярким светом, УФ-излучением или другими видами окислительного стресса. С дефицитом цинка в организме связывают структурные изменения сетчатки, снижение цветовосприятия. Таблетки круглой формы, без трещин и расслоений, покрытые оболочкой.

Изучая физиологию человека, Лайнус пришёл к выводу, что большинство хронических болезней обусловлено нехваткой витаминов и микроэлементов. Присутствие в организме «правильной массы» этих вещест помогает сохранить здоровье и улучшить состояние во время болезни. Фармацевтические компании творчески развили идеи Полинга. Продуктовая линейка Ортомол включает 28 комплексов для мужчин и женщин, любого возраста и образа жизни. Каждый витаминный комплекс предназначен для решения конкретных задач. Этим обусловлена эффективность витаминов Ортомол: улучшение самочувствия наступает почти сразу, излечение болезни происходит после двух-трёх курсов принятия витаминов. ОРТОМОЛЬ ФЕМИН (\\\"Orthomol® Femin\\\") КУРС 90 ДНЕЙ - этот мультивитаминный комплекс включает в себя витамины D3, Е, С, группы В, а также микроэлементы (альфа- и бета-каротин, коэнзим Q10) и Омега-3 жирные кислоты, которые стабилизируют его состояние и насыщают необходимыми в это кризисное время питательными веществами. Комплекс для улучшения самочувствия женщины во время менопаузы. Период менопаузы, который также называют климаксом -  период серьезных гормональных изменений. Этот длительный и очень сложный для организма процесс существенно влияет на здоровье женщины. При понижении уровня эстрогена в женском организме происходят следующие изменения: увеличение веса; проблемы с обменом веществ и жировым обменом; приливы (обильное потение, приливы крови); метаморфозы, происходящие в костной и хрящевой тканях.

На протяжении десятилетий БИОСИЛ® дает людям по всему миру огромные преимущества в сохранении здоровья и красоты. Красота, юность и здоровье Взаимосвязь между красотой, молодостью и здоровьем (и это медицинский факт) очевидна. Основополагающим критерием этих аспектов является количество и качество коллагена в организме человека. Его название происходит от греческого слова kolla (клей), что в целом описывает основную функцию вещества - он составляет основу соединительной ткани организма. То есть, коллаген отвечает за нормальное функционирование кожи, волос, ногтей, костей, хрящей, кровеносной системы. Организм человека синтезирует коллаген самостоятельно, но с возрастом и под воздействием различных факторов данная способность нарушается, а запас белка начинает истощаться. В молодом возрасте его уровень достаточен, а структура имеет плотный сетчатый рисунок. Поэтому молодая кожа выглядит гладкой, увлажненной и упругой, ногти остаются крепкими и ровными, а волосы - густыми, сильными и блестящими, излучая здоровье и красоту и функционируя с максимальной эффективностью. Невозможно переоценить роль коллагена и в строении костей, ведь именно он увеличивает их минеральную плотность, придавая так необходимые им гибкость и прочность. Более того, коллаген является основным компонентом суставов, сухожилий, связок и хрящей. Также важна его роль в поддержании здоровья кровеносных сосудов, сердца, легких, почек и печени. Метаболизм коллагеновых волокон на фоне возрастных изменений После 21 года уровень коллагена и эластина начинает уменьшаться на 1-1,5% в год. Именно тогда коллагеновая «сетка» начинает разрушаться. Начиная с этого возраста женская кожа становится тоньше на 7% каждые 10 лет. Кроме этого, в течение первых 5-ти лет после наступления менопаузы содержание коллагена в организме снижается на 6% в год. Потеря коллагена снижает и минеральную плотность костей, приводя к их ломкости. УФ-лучи также являются существенным фактором, приводящим к снижению уровня коллагена в коже. Курение, стресс и плохое питание - все это также ведет к потере коллагена и эластина, в результате чего кожа становится тоньше. Потеря коллагена и эластина влияет и на правильное функционирование внутренних органов и зрения. Снижение уровня эстрогена и высокий уровень гомоцистеина также являются причиной расщепления коллагена в организме человека. Возможен ли синтез коллагена Как часто хочется вернуть что-то безнадежно потерянное! Это особенно актуально в отношении коллагена. И не удивительно - результаты двойных слепых плацебо-контролируемых клинических испытаний показывают существенное улучшение выработки коллагена у пациентов, принимающих БИОСИЛ®. Он действительно запускает процесс синтеза собственного коллагена, работая естественным образом. В организм не попадает ничего постороннего, он просто активизирует природные ферменты, генерирующие коллаген. Именно поэтому происходит выработка своего собственного, естественного коллагена, подобно тому, как это происходит в 18 лет. И это коллаген с отпечатком собственной ДНК! Кроме того, клинически доказано, что БИОСИЛ® абсолютно безопасен. Он позволяет вернуть утраченный, генерировать новый и защищать существующий коллаген от расщепления. Как защитить существующий и вновь сформированный коллаген от будущей потери БИОСИЛ® активирует ферменты, вырабатывающие коллаген, благодаря чему происходит восстановление утраченного и синтез нового. Но одной из особенностей, которые делают БИОСИЛ® поистине уникальным препаратом, является его способность защищать существующий и недавно полученный коллаген. Каким же образом? Вы наверняка слышали о гомоцистеине. Он является одной из важнейших аминокислот, которые входят в состав клеток нашего организма. Этот компонент участвует в общем метаболизме, обеспечивает нормальный кровоток, работу сердечно-сосудистой системы и безвреден при нормальных значениях. При его повышенном уровне происходит разрушение коллагена. Вот почему ученые часто называют его «антиколлагеновой» аминокислотой. Повышение уровня гомоцистеина в организме может быть результатом процесса старения или следствием менопаузы. Но есть и хорошие новости - активный ингредиент БИОСИЛ®, запатентованный комплекс ch-OSA® (стабилизированная холином ортокремниевая кислота) нейтрализует разрушительное действие гомоцистеина при его повышенном уровне. Это означает, что прием БИОСИЛ® дает возможность вырабатывать новый коллаген, защищая и существующий. Как доказана эффективность БИОСИЛ® Понятие «клинически проверенный» в научном мире не всегда базируется на серьезной доказательной базе. И тестирование препарата не означает, что результаты будут непременно положительными. Такие термины, как «клинические исследования» или «клиническая оценка» употребляются даже при проведении весьма неформальных тестов, в том числе, на малочисленных группах участников. Результаты часто выражаются «мнением», а не научными показателями. Золотой стандарт тестирования - двойное слепое рандомизированное плацебо-контролируемое клиническое исследование. Результаты таких испытаний должны быть рассмотрены как «статистически значимые» и опубликованы в рецензируемых медицинских журналах, прежде чем какие-либо факты могут быть предъявлены общественности. Именно этим стандартам следуют разработчики БИОСИЛ®. Как скоро станет видимым результат приема БИОСИЛ® БИОСИЛ® начинает работать с первого же дня приема, активируя вырабатывающие коллаген ферменты. И неважно, какова потеря коллагена на этот момент. Далее приведены результаты клинических испытаний БИОСИЛ® как в отношении поддержания здоровья и красоты. Результаты клинических исследований* Измерения в отношении кожи проводились через 20 недель, для волос - через 36 недель приема. БИОСИЛ® способствует • уменьшению тонких линий и морщин до 30% • повышению эластичности кожи до 89% • увеличению толщины волос до 12,8% • усилению крепости волос до 13,1% • видимому укреплению ногтевой пластины В отношении воздействия на костную ткань БИОСИЛ® помогает • повышать минеральную плотность костей при тестировании в критической области бедра до 2% • увеличить образование коллагена в костной ткани и суставах до 15% Данные клинические испытания включали измерение минеральной плотности костей и прирост в выработке коллагена в течение 365 дней приема (стандартный интервал для измерения значимого улучшения здоровья костной ткани). Приведенные результаты показывают улучшения, выходящие за рамки преимуществ от ежедневного приема 1000 мг кальция и 800 МЕ витамина D. *Приведены данные по отношению к показателям после приема плацебо. Результаты могут варьироваться. Какого эффекта ожидать Каждый человек индивидуален. Как быстро станут видимыми результаты приема БИОСИЛ®, зависит от целого ряда аспектов - возраст, генетика, рацион питания, образ жизни и так далее. Однако, есть средние временные рамки, которые принимают во внимание. Кожа Клинические испытания показали, что БИОСИЛ® уменьшает тонкие линии и морщины до 30% и делает кожу более эластичной до 89%. Это результаты измерений, сделанных после 20-ти недель приема. Но это не означает, что в течение этого времени не происходило никаких других улучшений. БИОСИЛ® начинает работать с первого же дня приема. Еще один аспект, характеризующий здоровое состояние кожи - степень ее увлажненности. Молодая кожа хорошо увлажнена, отличается упругостью и эластичностью. Такую гидратацию изнутри обеспечивает гликозаминогликаны - семейство молекул, которые вместе с волокнами коллагена и эластина образуют в тканях соединительный матрикс. По сути, они работают, как магниты, притягивающие влагу. Коллаген служит связующим звеном для этих увлажняющих молекул. Больше коллагена означает их большее количество. Вот почему возрастная потеря коллагена сопровождается уменьшением гликозаминогликанов и вызывает сухость кожи. БИОСИЛ® помогает восстановить утраченный, синтезировать новый и защитить существующий коллаген. Прием препарата прекрасно увлажняет кожу изнутри, делая ее более красивой, молодой и здоровой. Волосы Различия в темпах роста, состоянии и качестве волос у разных людей также объясняются возрастом, генетикой и влиянием окружающей среды. Однако, клинически доказано, что после 36-ти недель приема БИОСИЛ® толщина волос увеличивается до 12,8%, а крепость - до 13,1%. Прием препарата заставляет также волосы расти намного быстрее. Кроме густоты и силы, есть еще одно потрясающее преимущество, которое дает БИОСИЛ® - он придает волосам прекрасный блеск. Это неудивительно, поскольку он помогает накапливать в структуре волоса больше кератина, разглаживая его поверхность и делая ее более гладкой и светоотражающей. Ногти Как и волосы, ногти на 98% состоят из кератина. С годами его синтез в организме ослабевает. Вот почему ногти с возрастом чаще ломаются или трескаются. Слабость ногтей может быть и следствием нехватки витаминов. Но здоровые и крепкие ногти будут ровными и гладкими. Исследования показывают, что клинически подтвержденный комплекс ch-OSA® в БИОСИЛ® помогает улучшить структуру кератина в ногтях. Результат - более крепкие, ровные, красивые ногти. Улучшение состояния ногтей - первое преимущество, которое становится заметным после начала приема БИОСИЛ®. Это и есть видимое доказательство того, что препарат по-настоящему работает. Кости Клинические испытания БИОСИЛ® доказали, что его прием в сочетании с кальцием и витамином D всего за 1 год увеличивает минеральную плотность костной ткани на полные и клинически значимые 2%, а образование коллагена - до 15%. Для действительно крепких и здоровых костей требуется именно сочетание кальция и коллагена. Матрица коллагена служит связующим участком для всего костного кальция. Больше коллагена означает больше костных минералов. Еще более важно то, что он придает костям гибкость, необходимую для того, чтобы выдерживать нагрузки, например, сопротивление при внезапном ударе. Поддерживая их крепкими и упругими, можно сохранить энергию и активность на всю жизнь. БИОСИЛ®, помогает увеличить образование костного коллагена и усилить минеральную плотность костной ткани. Суставы Суставы представляют собой комбинацию из хрящей, связок, сухожилий и, конечно, костей. Но есть то, что связывает эти компоненты - все они почти полностью состоят из коллагена. Когда содержание коллагена уменьшается с возрастом или в результате травмы, суставы ослабевают. Коллаген снижает дегенеративность хрящевой ткани в случае остеоартрита, оказывая стимулирующий эффект на метаболизм протеогликанов в хрящевых клетках. Выработка коллагена оказывает поддержку здоровому функционированию суставов. Ученые, занимающиеся их изучением, называют коллаген их важнейшим структурным компонентом. Клинически доказано, что БИОСИЛ® способствует образованию коллагена в суставах. Именно поэтому большинство людей, принимающих БИОСИЛ® для лечения суставов, сообщают об улучшении уже в течение первых недель приема (наступление эффекта, однако, зависит от индивидуальных особенностей человека). В любом случае, БИОСИЛ® поможет вернуться к активному образу жизни, сделать вас более здоровыми и счастливыми! Почему недостаточно просто принимать коллаген, чтобы увеличить его уровень в организме В отличие от кальция, который можно принимать для увеличения его содержания в костной ткани, с коллагеном все не так просто. При приеме коллагена в виде таблеток, порошков, напитков или пептидов, организм воспринимает его не более, чем источник белка, расщепляя на аминокислоты и используя, прежде всего, в качестве источника пищи. Такова изначальная природа нашего орагнизма - поддерживать жизнь, а не красоту. Главная цель - синтез коллагена, а не увеличение его уровня за счет коллагеносодержащих препаратов. Но именно кремний способен сделать выработку коллагена наиболее эффективной. Поэтому и был создан БИОСИЛ® с комплексом стабилизированной холином ортокремниевой кислоты ch-OSA®, способный запустить процесс синтеза собственного коллагена. Что не менее важно, БИОСИЛ® не содержит каких-либо компонентов животного происхождения или морских организмов. Коллаген, который вы получаете с его помощью, вырабатывается естественным путем. Активируя производящие коллаген ферменты, БИОСИЛ® запускает процесс его синтеза в вашем организме. И вновь полученный коллаген будет иметь отпечаток вашей собственной ДНК! Как принимать БИОСИЛ® БИОСИЛ® можно принимать в любое удобное время, вне зависимости от приема пищи. БИОСИЛ® в жидкой форме можно просто добавить вместе с другими ингредиентами в блендер при смешивании любимого коктейля - бьюти-шейк БИОСИЛ® быстрого приготовления готов! Температура не влияет на эффективность БИОСИЛ®, поэтому его можно смешивать с горячим или холодным напитком. Можно ли принимать БИОСИЛ® вместе с другими пищевыми добавками Комбинированный прием с другими добавками никак не влияет на эффективность БИОСИЛ®. В любом случае, результат гарантирован. Можно ли принимать БИОСИЛ® вместе с лекарствами, отпускаемыми по рецепту Известных противопоказаний, которые запрещали бы принимать БИОСИЛ® с любыми лекарствами, отпускаемыми по рецепту, не существует. Однако, в качестве меры предосторожности, рекомендуем принимать БИОСИЛ® по крайней мере за час до или после приема любого лекарства, отпускаемого по рецепту или без него.

Значение этих полиненасыщенных жирных кислот связано со структурно-функциональной организацией клеточных мембран. Они являются предшественниками образующихся из них активных и важных биорегуляторов – эйкозаноидов линии Е3, влияют на процессы тромбообразования и тонус кровеносных сосудов. Включаясь в липидный бислой клеточных мембран полиненасыщенные жирные кислоты омега-3 регулируют их микровязкость, проницаемость, формируют соответствующее липидное окружение мембранных белков и ферментов, способствуют метаболизму холестерина в печени и его элиминированию из организма. В наше время дефицит потребления омега-3 среди детского и взрослого населения России составляет порядка 80%. Недостаток поступления омега-3 в организм сопровождается нарушением эластичности и текучести всех клеточных мембран организма и изменением жидкостных соотношений в водном балансе и ионных потоках, что неблагоприятно отражается на внутриклеточной передаче информации. 1 - Используется только натуральный рыбий жир запатентованной марки MEG-3®, производства швейцарской компании «DSM» - ведущего лидера в сфере производства биодобавок. MEG-3® получают в промысловых, устойчиво развивающихся рыбных хозяйствах при строжайшем соблюдении регламентов правительственных организаций.

Активное вещество: глицин, цианокобаламин (витамин В12), пиридоксина гидрохлорид (витамин В6), тиамина гидрохлорид (витамин В1). Действие: для повышения умственной работоспособности, уменьшения нервного и умственного напряжения, улучшения сна. Содержание в 2 таблетках (суточном приеме): Глицин, не менее 600 мг, что составляет 17% от адекватного уровня суточного потребления Пиридоксин (витамин B6), не более 6 мг, что составляет 300%* от адекватного уровня суточного потребления Тиамин (витамин B1), не более 5 мг, что составляет  357%* от адекватного уровня суточного потребления Витамин B12, не более 9 мкг, что составляет 900%* от адекватного уровня суточного потребления *Не превышает верхний допустимый уровень суточного потребления. Глицин Форте Эвалар отличается: 1. Высоким содержанием глицина (300 мг). В норме у человека преобладает влияние парасимпатической нервной системы (спокойствие), а при длительной нервной нагрузке баланс нарушается, и более активной становится симпатическая нервная система (активность). В результате повышенная активность, которая необходима человеку для решения конкретных задач, становится преобладающим состоянием перевозбуждения, которым сложно управлять. При этом снижается концентрация внимания, появляется чувство беспокойства, все труднее найти выход из сложной ситуации. Умственное напряжение, невозможность уснуть, расслабиться приводят к истощению нервной системы. С проблемой такого уровня сложно справиться самому. Во всем мире для решения этих проблем широко используется глицин - как нелекарственное средство, способствующее уменьшению стресса и умственного перенапряжения, причем в значительных количествах. 2. Действие глицина усилено витаминами B1, B6, B12 в таком соотношении, как они существуют в природе. Витамины группы В благотворно влияют на центральную и периферическую нервную систему, способствуют восстановлению поврежденных нервных волокон, помогают противодействовать стрессу. 3. Таблетки легко рассасываются, что способствует быстрому достижению эффекта: -повышению умственной работоспособности; -уменьшению нервного и умственного напряжения; -улучшению сна. Глицин Форте Эвалар не формирует зависимости при длительном приеме, поскольку содержит естественные для организма действующие компоненты. Специальные особенности: без сахара, без глютена, без ГМО.

Льняное масло предупреждает болезни сосудов и образование тромбов. Ежедневное употребление льняного масла способствует профилактике развития сердечных приступов, так как из-за уменьшения вязкости крови и нормализации уровня жиров в крови нагрузка на сердце снижается. Употребление в пищу ПНЖК способствует снижению показателей артериального давления.

Обнинск). Они соединили селен с биомолекулой  ксантеном - антиоксидантом, который является составной частью природных антиоксидантов - витамина Е и биофлавонидов. Полученное соединение не вызывает никаких побочных эффектов, даже при концетрациях, в сотни раз превышающих предельно допустимые. Описание активных компонентов: Суточная потребность человека в селене составляет 80-200 мкг. Это очень небольшая доза. При условии ежедневного поступления такого количества, за всю жизнь суммарный объём не превысит и половины чайной ложки! И даже это небольшое количество, к сожалению, получить с современными продуктами питания невозможно. Наши почвы практически не содержат селена. В результате каждый второй житель России страдает дефицитом селена. Восполнить недостаток селена помогает препарат \\\"СЕЛЕН-АКТИВ\\\". Это абсолютно безопасное средство разработчики назвали - умным элементом. Все дело в том, что молекула препарата, в которую встроен селен, в зависимости от потребности организма может работать либо как источник селена для органов и тканей, либо как самостоятельный антиоксидант. «Селен-Актив» прошел клинические исследования в ГНИЦ профилактической медицины Минздрава РФ и НИИ питания РАМН. Результаты показали, что прием таблеток «Селен-Актив» у больных с ишемической болезнью сердца, артериальной гипертонией и нарушением липидного обмена в дополнение к терапии сердечно-сосудистыми препаратами приводит к уменьшению интенсивности окислительных процессов, снижению уровня холестерина и артериального давления. «Селен-Актив» рекомендован в качестве дополнительного источника селена и витамина С: для улучшения функционального состояния сердечно-сосудистой системы; в качестве средства для нормализации обмена холестерина; для повышения функциональной активности антиоксидантной системы организма.

Незаменимыми (не вырабатываются организмом в нужном объеме) являются лишь три: - альфа-линоленовая (АЛК), - эйкозапентаеновая кислота (ЭПК), - докозагексаеновая (ДГК). АЛК  является кислотой только растительного происхождения. А кислоты ЭПК и ДГК содержатся в рыбьем жире. Омега-3 для спорта Для получения хороших результатов в спорте необходима корректировка рациона питания. Помимо большого количества белка, витаминов и микроэлементов, в рацион важно добавить омега-3 жирные кислоты. Регулярное употребление омега-3 значительно улучшает метаболизм белка, помогает ему легче усвоиться, а значит, укреплять мышцы. Кроме того, одной из причин разрушения мышц является воспаление, с которым борется омега-3. Так как омега-3 жирные кислоты участвуют в формировании клеточных мембран, то за счет этого они позволяют сохранять эластичность сухожилий, связок, хрящей, способствуют улучшению свойств внутрисуставной смазки, замедляют распад коллагеновых волокон. Омега-3 снижают уровень «плохого» холестерина, защищают сосуды и капилляры, поддерживают общий тонус организма, что помогает повысить выносливость на тренировках. Кроме того, омега-3 жирные кислоты обеспечивают более быстрое восстановление после физических нагрузок и травм.

Vita - жизнь) - низкомолекулярные органические соединения различной химической природы, необходимые для осуществления жизненно важных биохимических и физиологических процессов в живых организмах. Организм человека и животных не синтезирует витамины или синтезирует в недостаточном количестве, поэтому он должен получать их в готовом виде с пищей. Кроме витаминов, в рационе человека в малых дозах должны присутствовать другие незаменимые вещества - макро-  и микроэлементы. Они участвуют во многих жизненно важных обменных реакциях, некоторые из них необходимы для обеспечения должного уровня активности соответствующих витаминов. Недостаточное потребление белка, витаминов и минеральных веществ приводит к снижению устойчивости и адаптации организма к воздействию физических, химических и биологических факторов окружающей среды, в том числе  к бактериям и вирусам. Микроэлементы и витамины способствуют поддержанию естественной иммунной защиты, охраняя физические барьеры (кожа/слизистая), поддерживая тем самым системы клеточного иммунитета, а также производство антител. Витаминно-минеральный комплекс ВИТРУМ ИММУНАКТИВ VITRUM IMMUNACTIVE содержит 13 витаминов и 8 минералов, а также бета-глюканы и биофлаваноидный комплекс - необходимые компоненты, которые синергично работают для поддержки иммунитета: - Витамины А, С, Е способствуют улучшению барьерной функции слизистых оболочек, способствуют продукции иммуноглобулина А, интерферона, в слизистых оболочках дыхательного тракта, участвуют в антиоксидантной защите организма, что приводит к уменьшению прикрепления и дальнейшего проникновения бактерий и вирусов. - Витамины В6, В12, С, D, Е и фолиевая кислота наряду с микроэлементами (железо, цинк, медь и селен) действуют синергично в поддержке функционирования иммунных клеток. Недостаточное потребление этих витаминов и микроэлементов может приводить к подавлению иммунитета - Селен и цинк - природные элементы антиоксидантной системы защиты организма человека. Цинк участвует в дифференциации лимфоцитов, особенно Т-звена, ускоряя появление иммунного ответа на инфекцию в организме. Среди иммуномодулирующих эффектов цинка, которые имеют прямое отношение к защите от вирусной инфекции, является стимуляция производства интерферона-альфа и интерферона-гамма. Селен регулирует производство иммуноглобулина G, повышает активность лимфоцитов. - Бета-глюканы ? природные вещества (полисахариды), которые содержатся в водорослях, злаковых, растениях, грибах, бактериях, дрожжах. Бета-глюканы активизируют клетки иммунной системы, способствуют защите от влияния патогенных микроорганизмов. - Биофлавоноиды (их собирательно называют витамином Р) - растительные соединения, которые содержатся в плодах, цветах и стеблях различных растений, особенно цитрусовых и розоцветных. Биофлавоноиды - сильные природные антиоксиданты, они способствуют лучшему усвоению витамина C, улучшают состояние сосудистой системы, укрепляют стенки капилляров.

Действующие вещества заключены в «продуктовые мицеллы» диаметром около 30 нм, которые являются основным компонентом солюбилизатов NovaSOL. Солюбилизаты устойчивы к кислотам (pH независимы), температуре и механическому воздействию, являются амфифильными (водо- и жирорастворимыми), имеют органическую формулу, исключающую наличие неорганических нано частиц (полностью метаболизируются в организме). Обладают повышенной биодоступностью и скоростью кишечного всасывания, ультратонким распределением. Имитируют природную структуру физиологических мицелл. Выводятся печенью и почками без повышения нагрузки на эти органы. Активные ингредиенты: -Витамин А осуществляет в организме две главные функции: способствует нормальному росту и развитию организма (принимает участие в синтезе стероидных гормонов (прогестерон), сперматогенезе, в окислительно-восстановительных процессах (синтез АТФ), регуляции синтеза белков, в формировании костей и зубов, необходим для роста новых клеток, замедляет процесс старения, способствует поддержанию постоянного уровня сахара в крови, помогая организму более эффективно использовать инсулин) и обеспечивает нормальное функционирование зрения, особенно сумеречного (входит в состав зрительных пигментов родопсина и йодопсина). Витамин А обеспечивает нормальное функционирование слезных, сальных, потовых желез и повышает устойчивость организма к инфекциям. Потребность в витамине А резко возрастает при повышении температуры окружающей среды и времени пребывания на солнце, при низкожировом питании. -Витамин Д регулирует фосфорно-кальциевый обмен (стимулирует выработку в кишечнике белка-носителя, необходимого для транспорта кальция, в почках и мышцах усиливает реабсорбцию кальция) и участвует в синтезе серотонина (отвечает за хорошее настроение и сон). От него зависит развитие костей, зубов, волос, качество мышечного сокращения, восприимчивость организма к кожным заболеваниям, болезням сердца и к раку. В странах, где пища бедна витамином Д, повышена заболеваемость атеросклерозом, артритами, диабетом, особенно 1 типа. Потребность в витамине Д возрастает при длительном пребывании в помещении, в более холодное время года, при низкожировом питании. -Витамин Е: препятствует тромбообразованию, участвует в синтезе гормонов, процессах тканевого дыхания, поддерживает иммунитет, обладает антиканцерогенным эффектом, обеспечивает нормальное функционирование мускулатуры и половых желез. Потребность в витамине Е увеличивается в более холодное время года и при низкожировом питании. -Витамин К: принимает участие в синтезе в печени протромбина (обеспечивает свертывание крови), участвует в обмене веществ в костях, соединительной ткани и работе почек. Рекомендации по применению: Для всех: • Повышенные физические, умственные нагрузки; • Вегетарианское питание; • Питание с пониженным содержанием жира; • Регулярный прием слабительных; • Прием препаратов с эстрогенами или андрогенами (тестостерон и его аналоги); • Нарушение сумеречного зрения («куриная слепота»); • Пожилой возраст; • Пребывание в очень жарком или очень холодном климате; • Нарушение сна; • Профилактика онкологии.

Железо относится к незаменимым микроэлементам необходимым для нормальной жизнедеятельности человека. При недостатке железа нарушается синтез гемоглобина, который выполняет важнейшую функцию в теле человека - транспорт кислорода к клеткам. Нормальное содержание железа важно для всех людей, но именно у женщин чаще всего наблюдается недостаток этого элемента вследствие регулярной ежемесячной потери крови, а также во время беременности, грудного вскармливания, в период роста и физического развития, полового созревания. Также в группу риска по дефициту железа входят и те, кто потребляет в больших количествах кофе, чай и другие напитки с кофеином.

Являясь жирорастворимым производным тиамина (витамина В1), бенфотиамин всасывается быстрее и более полно, чем водорастворимый тиамина гидрохлорид.

S-бензоилтиамин жирорастворим, обладает высокой проникающей способностью и всасывается в основном не превращаясь в тиамин.

Как работают ингредиенты Омега-6 (гамма-линоленовая кислота (ГЛК) - из кедрового масла, линолевая кислота (ЛК) - из льняного и кедрового масла) Особенно важным ингредиентом комплекса Омега 3-6-9 Супер от Эвалар является гамма-линоленовая кислота (ГЛК/GLA) - кислота из класса омега-6. Наличие ГЛК - это отличительная особенность кедрового масла. Несмотря на то, что ГЛК может синте зироваться в организме из линолевой кислоты, ее поступление с пищей чрезвычайно важно, так как со временем в организме снижается фермент, переводящий линолевую кислоту в ГЛК, и с возрастом этот процесс усиливается. ГЛК принимает участие в выработке гормоноподобных веществ - простагландин, которые помогают подавлять воспалительные, атопические1 и аутоиммунные процессы в организме. Существует несколько различных типов простагландинов, правильный баланс которых абсолютно необходим для того, чтобы организм был здоров. Простагландины, которые синтезируются из ГЛК, обладают выраженным противовоспалительным эффектом и являются важной частью клеточных мембран. Это и объясняет такое мощное действие ГЛК в борьбе с преждевременным старением, болезнями сердца, артритом, аллергиями. Кроме того, гипотензивное2, гипохолестеринемическое3, гиполипидемическое4, желчегонное и ранозаживляющее действие кедрового масла также связывают с активностью ГЛК в его составе. Омега-3 (эйкозапентаеновая кислота - из рыбьего жира, докозагексаеновая кислота - из рыбьего жира, альфа-линоленовая кислота - из льняного масла) Эйкозапентаеновая (ЭПК/EPA) и докозагексаеновая (ДГК/DHA) кислоты являются незаменимыми омега-3 жирными кислотами - то есть сами они не вырабатываются в организме. Низкий уровень этих кислот может вызвать серьезные проблемы со здоровьем. Они совершенно необходимы для многих функций организма, включая развитие и нормальное функционирование глаз и мозга. Исследования в области сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний показывают, что жители северных районов (эскимосы), которые в 10 раз меньше, по сравнению, например, с американцами, страдают сердечными заболеваниями. Также эскимосы реже заболевают раком, артритом, ожирением и диабетом. Это связывают с высоким потреблением жирной рыбы, богатой омега-3. У японцев, которые потребляют больше морских продуктов, чем американцы, также снижен уровень риска сердечных заболеваний. Современные исследования показывают, что омега-3 могут оказывать действие на артрит и псориаз, так как они обладают антивоспалительными свойствами. Прием их в больших дозах может снизить риск развития хронических воспалительных заболеваний. Кислоты класса омега-3 важны для работы всего организма, однако можно выделить ряд органов и систем, которым эти кислоты необходимы в первую очередь: • сердечно-сосудистая система • нервная система • иммунная система • органы зрения • кожа Омега-3 могут помочь снизить вязкость крови, улучшить кровоток, уменьшить уровень «плохого» холестерина, снижая тем самым вероятность образования тромбов, а также развития атеросклероза, ишемической болезни сердца, инфаркта и инсульта. Альфа-линоленовая кислота (АЛК/ALA) также является незаменимой омега-3 жирной кислотой. Ее основными источниками являются растительные масла, например, льняное. АЛК - главный компонент секрета сальных желез, обуславливающих защитное действие кожи. Омега-9 (олеиновая кислота - из льняного и кедрового масла) Наиболее важной из класса омега-9 кислот является олеиновая кислота (ОК/DA). Она присутствует в мембранах клеток и способствует поддержанию эластичности артерий и кожи. Также установлено, что в странах Средиземноморья, где в пищу употребляют большое количество оливкового масла, оливок, маслин, авокадо, орехов, относительно редко встречаются случаи сердечно-сосудистых и онкологических заболеваний. В большой степени это относится на счет омега-9 жирных кислот, присутствующих во всех этих пищевых продуктах. Признаки дефицита омега-9 в организме следующие: может развиваться общее или хроническое недомогание, от слабой усталости до сердечного приступа. Характерными признаками нехватки омега-9 в организме также является обострение сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний, повышение артериального давления, боли в суставах, артриты, ухудшение пищеварения, запоры, снижение иммунитета, частые простуды, ангина, депрессия, рассеянность, ухудшение памяти, усталость, недомогание, сухость кожи и слизистых, ломкие ногти, сухие, безжизненные волосы.

Омега-3 - это группа полиненасыщенных жирных кислот, важнейшими из которых являются докозагексаеновая кислота (ДГК), эйкозапентаеновая кислота (ЭПК) и альфа-линоленовая кислота (АЛК), относящиеся к незаменимым (эссенциальным) веществам. Незаменимые вещества необходимы для нормальной жизнедеятельности человека, но не синтезируются организмом или синтезируются в недостаточном количестве. Основным источником ДГК и ЭПК является рыбий жир, тогда как АЛК содержится преимущественно в растительных маслах. Потребность организма человека в ДГК и ЭПК намного выше, чем в АЛК, поэтому ДГК и ЭПК считаются основными веществами группы Омега-3 необходимыми человеку.

ITOH КОЛЛАГЕН С ГИАЛУРОНОВОЙ КИСЛОТОЙ Коллаген и гиалуроновая кислота - это важнейшие вещества, которые сохраняют молодость и красоту кожи и всего организма. К сожалению, с годами их выработка в организме уменьшается и происходит деградация соединительной ткани. Недостаток коллагена и гиалуроновой кислоты становятся причиной дряблости кожи, снижению её эластичности, прочности и тургора, появлению морщин, хрупкости волос. \\\"Коллаген с гиалуроновой кислотой\\\" поможет восполнить недостаток этих компонентов и улучшить не только вашу внешность, но и общее состояние здоровья. Коллаген I типа, входящий в состав препарата, является строительным материалом соединительной ткани, а также костной ткани, хрящей, связок и сухожилий. Именно благодаря этому белку она выглядит упругой, гладкой и эластичной, а волосы - блестящими и здоровыми. Коллаген способствует процессу регенерации тканей, росту и укреплению ногтей, сухожилий, связок и мышц. Гиалуроновая кислота - одна из важных составляющих здоровой и красивой кожи, которая отвечает за скорость процесса регенерации тканей.
